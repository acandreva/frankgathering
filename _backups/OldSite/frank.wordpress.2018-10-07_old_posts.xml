		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In October 2013, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/07/us/blackfish-wrap/">CNN</a> shared with us the story of SeaWorld’s Tilikum, a 12,000- pound male Orca whale, in the eye-opening documentary <em>Blackfish. </em>Tilikum was responsible for the deaths of three people, including his latest trainer Dawn Brancheau. The controversial documentary posed the question of whether Orcas should be held in captivity.

<!--more-->Blackfish had already created a stir earlier that year when it played in theaters around the country, including a run at the Hippodrome in downtown Gainesville, and SeaWorld is facign a 13 percent dropoff in park attendence

<em>Blackfish </em>is just one of many documentaries that have inspired both online and offline activism across the globe. Thefilm’s message <a title="inspired" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=0" target="_blank">inspired</a> an onslaught of Change.org petitions, celebrity Twitter endorsements, organized protests and a PETA campaign.

As communicators, we know the power of a compelling story. At <a href="http://vimeo.com/99758829"><em>frank</em></a><em>, </em>Frank Edwards shared with us how digital activism and nonviolent conflict are related and what makes digital activists’ campaigns successful in reaching their goals and mobilizing support for protests.

Outside of digital and print campaigns, it is still unclear as to which elements of an issue-driven motion picture or storyline will spur a viewer to take action. What is the magic formula that transforms a documentary like<em> Blackfish</em> into “effective motivational <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=4">weaponry</a>?”

To answer this question, Participant Media, with the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=2">help</a> of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the Knight Foundation and the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, is creating a standardized tool to measure the likelihood of action inspired by activist documentaries, films or clips, regardless of the ideological stance presented in the project.

“We’re developing a set of tools and measures that will be available for any researcher, no matter what their viewpoint,” said Martin Kaplan, director of the Norman Lear Center in the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.

Dubbed the Participant Index, the overall rating is the combination of the emotional and behavioral numbers, which is rated on a scale from 1 to 100.

The index uses “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=2http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=2">raw audience numbers</a>” for narrative films, documentaries and programming, as well as Facebook and Twitter activity. These two measurements are then compared to the results of a viewer survey, which captures information ranging from a participant’s emotional response to his or her level of engagement in the issue presented in the project.

During this stage of indexing several projects, the Participant Index will most likely confirm what is becoming clear to executives and producers in conventional film studios, according to RelishMIX CEO <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=2">Marc Karzen</a>.

A project’s impact can <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=2">focus</a> more on “nudging an audience to go where it is already pointed” than persuading neutral or opposing views.

There are still some exceptions to the methodologies used to measure the Participant Index. For example,<em> The Cove. </em>The 2009 documentary focuses on the slaughter of Japanese dolphins and shows the gruesome reality in horrific detail. Individuals, who were unable to handle the gory content, opted to not watch the film. However, many still engaged in efforts to save the Japanese dolphins.

Once the Index is finished, Participant Media will index projects for its partners, as well as companies that are willing to pay a still undecided fee. Participant’s Chief Executive James Berk <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/business/media/participant-index-seeks-to-determine-why-one-film-spurs-activism-while-others-falter.html?_r=2">anticipates</a> that the company will assist indexing nonprofit projects at cost.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I watched the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjJQBjWYDTs" target="_blank">#likeagirl video</a> that recently went viral.<strong> </strong>It is inspiring and gets people to see that using “you throw like a girl” as well-intentioned teasing is in fact a disempowering insult. The video’s director, Lauren Greenfield, summed up for the <em>Telegraph</em> what was so powerful about her approach of asking people to demonstrate what it means to run like a girl:
<blockquote>“That moment of realisation – when the women and men in our film suddenly understood that they had been sucked into this cultural cliché – is magical to witness, because the viewer also gets to experience it at the same time. It is not judgmental, but collegiate – a moment we share that is simple and yet instantly empowering and illuminating.”</blockquote>
&nbsp;

<!--more-->For many issues we work on – from racial equity to gender discrimination – we can’t simply lecture people about what’s right and wrong and expect change. We need them to experience the point we’re making, and decipher what it means to them personally. I call this epiphany messaging. It is messaging that sparks people to have epiphanies for themselves that motivate them to change their mind or behavior, or both. It isn’t easy to do, but incredibly powerful when it happens.

<strong>Hold up a mirror and let people see for themselves</strong>

A fellow FRANKster, Shankar Vedantam, writes about studies that show how to use <a title="hypocrisy" href="http://tinyurl.com/8sgbtk" target="_blank">hypocrisy </a>to motivate people.<strong> </strong>A critical element of this approach is getting people to see FOR THEMSELVES when and how they are hypocritical, instead of us calling them out as hypocrites. A psychologist in California used this with students who were not using condoms despite knowing the health risks, by asking them to make videos telling others the importance of safe sex. Once they made their heart-felt pitches, they became more likely to use condoms themselves. He credits “gently rubbing their face in their own hypocrisy” as the reason for behavior change that stuck.

<strong>Give them room to change their own mind</strong>

Another approach to change is seen in the research Third Way did that helped shape the messaging behind the freedom to marry movement for LGBT people. One of the most important recommendations they made was to “give people permission to change their minds about why gay couples marry.” They suggested featuring people as messengers who could describe changing their own opinion, and showing the journey they took. This allows others to reconsider their own position because they see someone like them doing it, and resolve a difficult issue in a way that aligns with their values. This ad shows this <a title="concept" href="http://tinyurl.com/omyhz4k" target="_blank">concept</a> in action.

<strong>Offer questions instead of answers</strong>

Researcher and author Anat Shenker-Osorio (@anatosaurus) shared yet another idea for developing epiphany messaging, specifically with progressives. In a recent talk, she suggested that this audience is more open to new ideas and will change their minds about issues if you spark curiosity rather than laying down the law. Instead of messages as statements, ask questions. For example, you could say something like ‘when is it ok for men to get paid more than women when they are doing the same job?’ This may lead to a more interesting response than if you say: women should be paid the same as men. By making a statement, people can think about exceptions when it might be ok to pay women less. However, when you ask them a question, many will come up with the same response that it is never okay to pay women less than a man for the same job. People believe it more when they come up with the answer themselves, rather than being told.

<strong>Let them motivate themselves</strong>

I’ll leave you with the brilliance of Nike’s Just Do It campaign. Not only is it memorable. When you see these <a title="ads" href="http://tinyurl.com/pxkwbwz" target="_blank">ads</a> in print or on TV,  the words “Just Do It” appear. They are never spoken. You say them to yourself. This mantra may lead to the epiphany that you need to get off the couch—and need new shoes to do so.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At 10 a.m., the trail is quiet, and if you hadn’t just driven into Elkin, NC, from Highway 268, you’d never know that a thriving downtown sits just on the other side of the thick tree line. Periodically a runner or dog walker passes and Bill Blackley, Elkin Valley Trails Association president, hands over a business card with a warm greeting during his daily walk.

<!--more-->He connects with people – asks them how they’re enjoying the day with genuine sincerity and tells them how they, too, can own a part of the North Carolina Mountain to Sea Trail, the state’s longest marked footpath. Of the 1,000 miles between the beginning of the trail in Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the ending at Jockey’s Ridge State Park in Nags Head, 672 miles are complete. The association Blackley leads is responsible for completing Elkin’s 60-mile section, and they’ve come a long way.

[caption id="attachment_203" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_0026.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-203" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/DSC_0026-300x198.jpg" alt="Naturalist Nancy Goodwin looks into the trail’s treetops for new plants and animals with Elkin Valley Trail Association President Bill Blackley." width="300" height="198" /></a> Naturalist Nancy Goodwin looks into the trail’s treetops for new plants and animals with Elkin Valley Trail Association President Bill Blackley.[/caption]

Volunteers in Elkin have raised more than $300,000, acquired several conservation easements and logged thousands of volunteer hours.

The connection that Blackley and other board members make with trail users is vital to their campaign’s success. Instead of selling, they’re engaging the community to create something useful and beautiful. Residents are excited to have a new place to run, walk dogs, kayak, ride horses, cycle and watch nature – they’ve already identified 73 different types of birds.
<p style="text-align: left;">They have a few rules: everybody is on the same rung of the ladder, they see opportunities not problems and everybody has something to contribute.</p>
And because they all have something to contribute, they’re credible. Each volunteer is an expert in his or her own field. There’s somebody for everything including robotics, engineering, planning, government, nature and architecture to name a few. For example, one board member plans to create a mobile application that will allow users to scan QR codes on markers along the trail to learn about the area’s history.

That kind of expertise leads to cut costs and engaged advocates because like Blackley says, “You can be a part of the trail – own it – by getting your hands in it.”

Blackley admits the trail could be completed more quickly if they paid a company to do it, but they’d lose the community support that’s made them so successful.

I picked up a piece of trash as he excitedly told me about what’s already been done and what’s to come. He saw me pick up the cigarette butt and said I owned part of the trail, too, now. I believe him. I came home fired up to tell everyone about Elkin and the history of the railroad, Revolutionary War battles, defunct shoe factory, and most importantly, the people who are so vested in making the world a better place.

Having volunteers who are genuinely enthusiastic about reaching a goal can easily draw in new supporters. Even from Raleigh, which is a 2.5-hour drive to Elkin, I’m an advocate of the trail because authenticity is a powerful approach.]]></content:encoded>

Sure, <em>slacktivism</em> represents fun wordplay, but I have a problem with the concept behind it. It fails to fully recognize that movements require various types of engagement and downplays more passive levels of involvement by using the pejorative label <em>slack. </em>Social change work requires people to engage in a variety of ways: some will wear the cause T-shirt, others will write occasional emails to policymakers, and yet others will organize and attend multiple events and meetings.

At a time when the information landscape is more cluttered than ever before, we need to showcase issues and relevant actions in a consistent way across multiple platforms. That means that bumper stickers, T-shirts and <em>likes</em> matter along with presentations, meetings and policy briefs. Does each tool or action play the same role in a social change movement? Of course not. But does each one play and important role? Definitely.

<strong>What does your “like” look like?</strong>

All <em>likes</em> are not equal. Consider what potential <em>likes</em> might say about you, as if you were taking a Buzzfeed quiz:

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Foodie.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-207" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Foodie.png" alt="Foodie" width="225" height="169" /></a>

You’re a foodie–or you need a snack.

&nbsp;

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/status.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-208" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/status-300x65.png" alt="status" width="300" height="65" /></a>

You’re happy that a friend is getting some downtime (or you’re really mean).

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/political.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-209" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/political-279x300.png" alt="political" width="279" height="300" /></a>

You want people to know that you believe that everyone has the right to marry the person who they love.

All of these statements can define who we are as people, and <a href="http://www.inderscience.com/info/inarticle.php?artid=62942">as the Norwegian study shows</a>, most of us “like” issues to communicate the importance of social responsibility. That <em>like</em> is an important part of a social change movement.

<strong>Looking for lots of <em>likes</em></strong>

Collective <em>likes </em>can improve online search results, start conversations and capture attention of other media channels. (Consider how often traditional news media sources speak to Twitter trends, for example.) Repetition matters in communications, and social media channels like Facebook can help with lots of <em>likes.</em> And each <em>like </em>and related post provides an opportunity for sharing consistent messages, which can make these <em>likes</em> even more effective.

So let’s drop the <em>slacktivism</em> label and embrace all types of activism. Most of us engage deeply on a few issues or social change movements and do what we can to support others. “What we can” might mean buying from a company with positive social values, putting a bumper sticker on the car or clicking <em>like.</em> Let’s do what we can where and when we can.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[To Reverend Richard Reedy, the large crowd gathered at the Thelma Boltin Community Center in Gainesville was a room full of complete strangers. Despite this potentially unnerving situation, Reedy spoke about the daily struggles of living with a mental illness in honest and vivid detail.

"I take these people with me everywhere. They yell at me, scream at me, tell me what to do,” said Reedy, who has battled PTSD and a form of psychosis for several years. The reverend wasone of four expert panelists on the Gainesville Sun’s Illness to Wellness: A Community Forum on Mental Health.

Alongside Reedy was Terrie Mullin, president of the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), Judge Denise Ferrero, a judge presiding over an Alachua County mental health court and Dr. Dawn Bruijnzeel, a psychiatrist at the local veterans’ hospital and UF Health. The forum was was held on May 28.

For Alachua County residents, this was an opportunity to learn about a topic that has long been stigmatized in the U.S. Hearing a community leader share intimate and candid details about a personal daily struggle isn’t an occurrence that happens often.

At <em>frank </em>2014, David Bornstein spoke about “solutions journalism” and how a positive feedback system can disrupt the “watchdog gloom and doom” mentality that ultimately leads to reducing the engagement and optimism needed to spur change. People need an understanding of the possibilities, meaning we can’t expect them to “roll up their sleeves” and go lobby Congress on issues that deserve attention, according to Bornstein. By establishing clear pathways, people can tangibly see the “how to” for drawing attention to those issues.

NAMI is an avenue that provides the “how to” manual for families or individuals who are supporting a loved one through the management of a mental illness.

“The more people involved and invested in that person’s wellness, the more likely that person is to get better.” Bruijnzeel said.

In 2013 alone, <a href="http://bakeract.fmhi.usf.edu/document/BA_Annual_2013_Redacted%20Final.pdf" target="_blank">171,744</a> individuals have been detained under the Chapter 394 statues of Florida law, known as the “Baker Act.” Involuntary commitment has recently become a hot topic in light of recent mass shootings across the United States.

"At some point does my right of Habeas Corpus end?"  said Rev. Richard Reedy, “I have a right to be crazy…I have a right to go dance on the side of the street as long as I’m not creating a public nuisance,” Reedy said.

The idea of involuntary commitment is walking a fine line, according to Reedy.

“I don’t know where I stand on this because if it was not for my wife forcing me to go to the VA Hospital, I wouldn’t be sitting here today,” he said.

This panel is a prime example of real-world application of solutions journalism. Engaging the community through mental health courts, education and public events can make a lasting difference in the health of individuals – and the health of the community. Through education, we can help communities embrace the idea that mental health is not an individual battle; it’s part of the community’s.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Good News Never Gets Old</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/08/good-news-never-gets-old/</link>
		<pubDate>Tue, 12 Aug 2014 21:10:23 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The other day I was going through some files and happened upon a study I hadn't looked at in a couple of years: <strong><em><a href="http://www.topospartnership.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Solutions-Storytelling.pdf">Solutions Storytelling: Messaging to Mobilize Support for Children’s Issues</a>.</em></strong>

Like the first I time read it, I found its findings refreshing and inspiring and filled with excellent guidance for those of us on the lookout for evidence of what works in social change communications. Especially uplifting was the study's underlying message that people pay attention to "good news" and they want to hear about solutions to problems that are working.

By way of background, this research was conducted on behalf of <a href="http://www.childadvocacy360.org/">Child Advocacy 360</a>, a group founded by a former publishing executive <a href="http://www.childadvocacy360.org/about">Hershel Sarbin</a>. Sarbin's goal is to "use the power of good news journalism and success stories to effect community, state and national change in social policy.”

Sarbin, who spent most of his professional career running Ziff-Davis Publishing and Cowles Business Media is no stranger to effective communications. He's also a strong believer that if people had more information about the good things being achieved on behalf of children, more people–individual citizens and policymakers alike–would be more inclined to support solutions for kids that are working.

It's not much of a stretch to take that underlying premise–that news about effective solutions can be a galvanizing force for work on behalf of children–and apply it to a range of social change programs that are focused on making the world a better place.

For the study, Topos Partnership, working with Douglas Gould &amp; Company, conducted online survey interviews with 2,006 registered voters nationwide. They also held six focus group sessions with voters in three states, and TalkBack Testing, in which 240 participants were tested on their ability to repeat the core of a message and pass it on to others.

Here's what the study revealed about how to communicate effectively, including what to do and what to avoid:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Don’t dwell on problems.</strong> While discussing problems has some benefits, “it can also backfire.”  As the research discovered, “Problem-focused stories increase support for government action, but at the same time increase cynicism about  the ability of government and citizens to solve these problems.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you want action that leads to better outcomes tell stories that describe solutions.</strong>  “People want to know who’s doing what that works.  Give good news a chance.  Instead of focusing on charity, emphasize the fact that collective responsibility and the power of people working together for change, yields solutions.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Make it clear who benefits</strong>. In communicating about what works and what needs to be done, keep communities "in the forefront" as beneficiaries of what's working.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Help people see the “big picture.”</strong>  “Briefly discussing a number of very different programs is one straightforward way of focusing less on a particular case study, and more on the general principle that we can and should be taking greater responsibility" solving problems in our communities.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Be more aggressive in making the case for necessary programs.</strong> “When people have a concrete picture of how a program helps, they are more likely to see it as important” (and necessary).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Don’t leave people guessing about what they should do—give them examples.</strong> “Communicators should specifically incorporate model examples of the behavior we want to encourage. Modeling behavior helps people visualize the ways they could make a difference.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Show proof of effectiveness, but don’t obsess over what will be convincing.</strong>  Researchers found that “people’s standard of ‘proof’ isn’t particularly high, as long as they have a sense of how an intervention helps.” It’s always best to use hard statistical proof, if you have it. But if not, anecdotal support can sometimes be just as effective.</li>
</ul>
In the final analysis, this report contains a lot of what we all have believed. It also underscores the importance of what many of us spend our time doing—trying to connect people to stories that demonstrate what works. But now, along with guidance to help shape our messages, we have some assurance that these approaches work.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s been time for frank to grow for a long time.

This week, we proudly and nervously launched our new site. We’re not just about frank the gathering anymore. frank has become a place where we hope to nourish a community of change makers.

We’re sharing great new research on frankology, we’ve launched a blog where smart people like Kristen Grimm, Erin Hart and Jessica Wells are sharing new ideas and insights. You can watch any of the talks from last year’s inaugural frank gathering in Clips.

In a few weeks, we’ll add more: finds, a curated collection of content from around the web and frankslist, a place where you can list or find job opportunities, funding opportunities, and announcements about other conferences and events that are relevant to our growing field.

These are small steps that we’ve needed to take for a long time. I’m so grateful to our extraordinary students like Annie Neimand, who hatched the idea of frankology; Victoria Colson who collected and curated content; Katie Burns, who has developed and executed a social media strategy; William England, who is our visual coordinator; Calvin Moore, our programmer; Dustin Tulio, the designer who created the opening video and helped us ensure that the site offers a beautiful experience for our visitors.

Despite these extraordinary resources, the site wouldn’t be live if it weren’t for Emily Culbertson, who pointed me toward the endlessly patient Jai Sen at Sen Associates. Jai developed the site, smiled as we discarded three different approaches, and created the visual tagging system that uses the beautiful buttons Lauren Castro designed for frank2014 as a navigational tool. Alison Byrne Fields was much cooler about me stealing her theme than she needed to be. And Mac Prichard has not only allowed us to adopt Mac’s List for the frank community, but has given great advice along the way.

Typically, I underestimated just how much work frank would be. But one day, as I sat with Bruce Trachtenberg over a cup of coffee and shared my anxiety, he said in his wonderful and unassuming way, “I can help you.” And then, wonderfully and beautifully, he did. He stepped in and took charge of whipping content into shape, and finding ways to bring in new content regularly and seamlessly. So now, Bruce is frank’s executive editor, and we are all better for it.

There are lots more people who helped in large and small ways to make this site real. But the site wouldn’t be live if Ellen Nodine hadn’t demanded that we set aside our fears and launch it.

I’d love to see your work here, too. Got a post you want to share? Send it to me. Is there something big we’re missing? <a title="Contact" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/contact/">Please let me know.</a> We’ve made this for you. Let us make it good.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>It&#039;s Shocking What Some People Think Is Good Advertising -- And It&#039;s A Good Thing They Do</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/08/using-shocking-ads-to-incite-activism/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[That ad is shocking -- <i>isn't it?</i>  But it's no accident, either. <i><i>It supposed to shock you! </i></i>After seeing that ad, are you likely to talk on the phone to someone who tells you she or he is driving in her car? Do you want their blood on your hands?

The reason shock advertising doesn't repel but actually grabs us is because of the emotional reaction--even the offense--we feel when we see images that violate societal <a title="norms" href="http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=179604&amp;fileId=S0021849903030332" target="_blank">norms</a>.  Over the years, some successful ads have gone beyond the limits of taste, even decency, to shock us out of our seats and get us to take action.

Critically acclaimed photographer Oliviero Toscani used shocking images to transform the face of advertising throughout the 80’s and 90’s in his campaigns for Italian fashion brand Benetton. Combining social commentary with the harsh reality of business, Toscani pushed the envelope by depicting the not-so-glamorous reality of dying AIDS patients and anorexic fashion models.

According to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/08/13/oliviero.toscani/index.html">Toscani</a>, “there isn't such a thing as a shocking picture, there is shocking reality that is being reproduced through photography to the people who aren't there.”

Toscani’s boldness has inspired advertisers to rethink the boundaries of the advertising industry. Several communication firms, advertising agencies and NGOs have used juxtaposed images or gruesome visual metaphors to create gripping social advertisements and campaigns.

In 2006, human rights advocacy group Amnesty International created the “It's Not Happening Here, But It's Happening Now” campaign in Sweden. Based out of Zurich, advertising agency walker Werbeagentur created 200 posters to <a href="http://www.walker.ag/en/2006/05/01/es-geschieht-nicht-hier-aber-jetzt/">sensitize</a> people to human rights abuses, as well as to create a forum to discuss these atrocities that occur every day. This ingenious campaign brought brutal scenes onto the streets of Zurich, artfully blending the subjects of abuse into the otherwise ordinary urban environment.

So, do these kinds of arresting but profoundly disturbing ads work?

Here are several other notable campaigns from agencies around the world (click to enlarge):

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Great insight Victoria. The quote you used from Toscani really sums up the entire premise behind shock marketing "there isn’t such a thing as a shocking picture, there is shocking reality that is being reproduced through photography to the people who aren’t there.”

If you have a chance I think you would like an in depth article I put together that touches on shock marketing and social issue ads. It is called "The 100 Most Powerful Social issue Ads Ever Created" and can be seen: http://www.cmobrain.com/100-powerful-social-issue-ads-ever-created/  

I enjoyed your article. I hope to get your feedback.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>How To Get Rid of Jargon, A Public Interest Communicator&#039;s Worst Nightmare</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[He probably wouldn’t like me to call it a <em>crusade</em>, but it’s hard to think of the fight <a href="http://www.tonyproscio.com/" target="_blank">Tony Proscio</a> has been waging for almost 15 years against the use of jargon in discussions about public policy matters as anything less than that.

For it to be a successful crusade, though, his writings on the subject should be required reading for every public interest communicator. For those unfamiliar with his works, the best place to start is with the first of his <a href="http://www.tonyproscio.com/#Jargon?id=Jargon%20Essays" target="_blank">three book-length essays</a> on the subject: “<a href="http://issuu.com/comnetwork/docs/inotherwords?mode=embed&amp;layout=http%3A%2F%2Fskin.issuu.com%2Fv%2Flight%2Flayout.xml&amp;showFlipBtn=true" target="_blank">in other words</a>."

In that volume, Proscio minces no words. He writes that when people on the forefront of social policy work pepper their writing and speaking with jargon, the real danger is not that audiences will get annoyed, but “the repetitive, habitual use of insider lingo undermines the inherently public nature of the social issues under discussion.”

Fast forward to today and we find that Proscio is still fighting against “bad words for good.” He's also continuing to dispense advice to help social change communicators ward off their worst nightmare: writing and speaking that dulls, stupifies and kills useful public discourse. He recently shared his thoughts about jargon’s continuing pernicious effects <a href="http://ec.libsyn.com/p/0/7/0/070b0fd2b34fd442/Proscio.mp3?d13a76d516d9dec20c3d276ce028ed5089ab1ce3dae902ea1d06c8823ed6c15cbc6d&amp;c_id=7301898" target="_blank">in a podcast interview</a> with the Communications Network.

As he told interviewer <a href="http://prichardcommunications.com/about/mac-prichard/" target="_blank">Mac Prichard</a>, the reason to avoid jargon--<em>advice every public interest communicator should take to heart</em>--is that the "whole point of inspiring people to do things is that you reach them at a level that’s both emotional and intellectual. The emotions are stirred by emotional speech and the intellect is stirred by originality. Neither of those things is going to come from a lot of cliché, jargon, abstractions, and technicalities.”

The entire interview is worth a listen, especially for the tips Proscio shares about how to rid your own writing and speaking of jargon. Here's a quick sample:
<ul>
	<li>“Summon up an image of your audience while you’re writing. Not even the whole audience, just someone in it who is likely to need persuading or need explaining.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>“Make a list for yourself of the terms that are likely to sound technical or abstract, that are likely to be overused but maybe are not going to be well understood that are too vague, then it will be very easy for you to recognize when you are using those words in whatever you write."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>“Make an outline. Not for the purpose of absolutely governing what your paper is ultimately going to say or what your speech is going to contain, more for the purpose of writing down short phrases, short clear crisp original phrases that describe the points you want to make.”</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>“Read it out loud.”</li>
</ul>
Finally, if you are not sure whether a word is jargon, <a href="http://www.comnetwork.org/category/jargon/" target="_blank">check out this handy list</a> from our friends at the Communications Network.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Five Reasons Why frank Matters for Social Change</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/08/five-reasons-why-frank-matters-for-social-change/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As everyone gears up for the <a title="2015 gathering" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/" target="_blank">2015 gathering</a>, here are <em>my </em>five reasons why frank matters for social change communicators.
<ol>
	<li>frank gives us a common definition for the work we do. The guiding principle of frank is that we’re a community that uses communications “to win on the issues we all work to overcome.” frank positions the role of communications within social change and helps all of us become better practitioners of strategies and tools to help achieve success in our respective pursuits.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>frank shines a <a title="spotlight" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/" target="_blank">spotlight</a> on practical knowledge. Before frank, I was in the dark about the amount of research available – some of it taking place within academia – about how social change happens. Now when I talk to clients about why a proposed communications strategy may or may not work, I can point to evidence to help make the case for why that is the best approach.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>frank shows us how to connect to emotions in our work. Like many social change communicators, I believe storytelling has the power to change the world. frank helps us get better at using stories by showing us how to use emotion to appeal to the hearts of our target audiences and get them to take action on the issues we care most about.At the 2014 frank gathering, two presenters–<a title="Kristina Robbins and Marjan Safinia" href="http://vimeo.com/90161161" target="_blank">Kristina Robbins and Marjan Safinia</a> from the Department of Expansion, who produce story-driven documentaries for social causes–showed us the difference between the typical nonprofit video approach that is overly reliant on facts and figures and a video that is meant to produce an emotional response from audiences. The video they shared helped a California youth nonprofit to increase its fundraising by 30 percent.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li>frank gives us a peek at how technology is changing our field. At frank, we get a chance to see and hear first-hand from changemakers around the country who are developing and deploying new technologies and what these new tools mean for our work.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li>frank is all of “us.” Through the Frank Karel Fellows Program, frank is helping build a more diverse and inclusive community of social change communicators. The 2013 Fellows who spoke at frank represent a diversity of gender, race, sexuality and income backgrounds who help ensure the field can effectively devise strategies and campaigns that reflect the experiences and realities of all our communities.</li>
</ol>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few weeks ago Ann Christiano formally "christened" frank <strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/08/we-made-you-something/" target="_blank">with a blog post equivalent</a> </strong>of breaking a bottle of champagne across the bow.

		<title>You Won’t Feel The Same After You See These Dancers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently asked my filmmaker friend <a href="http://www.hottotrotfilm.com/creative-team/" target="_blank">Gail Freedman</a> whether the motivation for her latest project is to make what she hopes will be a well-viewed and well-received documentary or to raise public awareness and advance change by shining the spotlight on a fascinating but little known aspect of LGBT—and international—culture that merits more attention.

Her response to both questions: <em>the same.</em>

[caption id="attachment_2494" align="alignright" width="200"]<img class="wp-image-2494 size-full" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Gail-Freedman2.jpg" alt="Gail_Freedman2" width="200" height="200" /> Gail Freedman[/caption]

Her answer was not surprising considering her film goes inside the world of <em>same-sex</em> ballroom dancing, where — as she puts it — personal passion meets political muscle.  Called “Hot to Trot,” the film is meant to introduce—even those of who of us who think we’re fully up to speed on cultural trends—to a growing phenomenon probably few really know about or will have examined as deeply she intends to do with her documentary.

According to Freedman, ballroom dance is enjoying a renaissance here in America, as well as abroad, embraced by everyone from grandparents to grad students. “But there’s one form of this storytelling-in-motion,” says Freedman, “that is not seen in mainstream venues: same-sex couple dancing. Yet it too is surging in popularity, remaking lives and bodies, along with popular culture and gender politics.”

Over the course of the film, "Hot to Trot" follows the overlapping personal narratives of several talented same-sex dancers as their complex lives unfold, on and off the dance floor, including competing at the 2014 Gay Games, the international Olympics-like competition of the LGBT community (with all the attendant dramatic tension about winning or losing this ultimate prize). At the same time the film tells these resonant personal stories, it effortlessly explores larger social and cultural themes. It's a captivating combination.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/8j30DbFT-oM" width="700" height="394" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

“Because the entry point for this film is dance,” Freedman says, “it has appeal to a wide audience. The beauty and the unalloyed joy are what originally attracted me to this — and then, the more I dug in, the richer it got, and I saw clearly what a good, and even important, film this could be: great characters, terrific subject, a lot of layers. And a real unexpected dimension that set it apart: it is political, but these dancers are living the issues, rather than working them. And the power and the traction of that captured me. We know that culture makes change. Because this film sits at the intersection of art, politics, and passion, it can entertain people and equally be a catalyst for new understanding, attitudes, and action.”

While Freedman’s film is not yet completed—75 percent of it has been shot—she’s already doing what she can to foster a conversation about how our world can only be a better place when people are allowed to pursue their passions free of stigma or the need to justify their choices.
<blockquote><em>We're at a real inflection point as a society...It's a time of unprecedented change. I think this film can be part of that.</em></blockquote>
Along with a number of speaking appearances and presentations about the project, other pre-release activities include a <a href="http://www.hottotrotfilm.com/" target="_blank">website </a>that features a teaser-trailer from the film culled from early footage, which she plans to keep updating as the project moves forward, as well as profiles of some of the dancers featured in the film, for each of whom a small backstory is presented.

Among the featured characters is <a href="http://www.hottotrotfilm.com/portfolio/emily-coles/" target="_blank">Emily Coles</a>, pictured wearing a tuxedo, who started her dance career at age 5 prancing on stage with nine other little girls in tutus and slippers. She loved the stage, but the tutu was not a fit. Emily has severe, lifelong Type 1 diabetes, which was diagnosed at age 3, and remains a daily, significant struggle.

Another star of the film is <a href="http://www.hottotrotfilm.com/portfolio/ernesto_palma/" target="_blank">Ernesto Palma</a>, who started life as a poor, bullied youth in Costa Rica, and has done some hard living in his 33 years (he's a former meth addict). He’s known since boyhood that he was gay and has always been determined “to live the life I was born to live.”  By contrast, his dance partner, <a href="http://www.hottotrotfilm.com/portfolio/nikolai-shpakov/" target="_blank">Nikolai Shpakov</a>, grew up in Russia, the only child of an architect and an attorney. Although he started dancing "before I learned how to walk," his early path was more conventional, until he decided to follow his muse, emigrated to New York, and found enormous success on the Latin ballroom circuit.  He has only come out in the last few years and is still coming to terms with that public identity.  His new dance partnership with Ernesto is his first with a man.
<blockquote><em>I want this film to foster a conversation about how our world can only be a better place when people are allowed to pursue their passions free of stigma or the need to justify their choices..</em></blockquote>
It’s the dancers and their spirit and fervor that sparked Freedman’s initial interest in this film, and it's also a topic that stands apart from other subjects--9/11, cancer, poverty--that she’s tackled over the past 20 years.

Ultimately, what she wants people to take away from the film is the idea that by “transforming yourself you can rock the world.” Adds Freedman, "We're at a real inflection point as a society. It's a time of unprecedented change. I think this film can be part of that."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Did you hear the one about the Ice Bucket Challenge?</em>

You know that time when people had a few laughs while bringing attention to the need to pour more money into research designed to find a cure for ALS?

As that experience showed, sometimes it’s ok to use humor to get people to think about tough topics—the day-to-day stuff that social change communicators grapple with all the time.

According to Kate Emanuel, senior vice president of Non-Profit and Government Affairs for the Ad Council, “Increasingly, causes and nonprofits are breaking through the tried-and-true fray to deliver serious messages, even matters of life and death, with humor.” In other words, to be seen and heard, you don’t always have to aim for the heart. The funny bone sometimes makes a good target.

Says Emanuel, “When you get down to it, really no topic has to be off limits--you can make any topic funny. So, instead of asking, ‘Can it be funny?’ perhaps a nonprofit or cause should ask instead, ‘What’s the best way to use humor to address serious subjects?’" Her advice: always start with a very smart creative brief—you need to understand your target, their motivations, the tone and message. Adds Emanuel, "Don’t just wing it and be funny for funny’s sake."

The best way to show how humor can be put to good use is let these examples speak for themselves.

Sit back, enjoy and maybe have a few laughs…on us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="color: #222222;">Sometimes the simple approach wins out over more complicated strategies when trying to move the needle on big issues.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">That’s one of the lessons from </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://moveed.org/" target="_blank">MoveED,</a><span style="color: #222222;"> an online and social media-driven campaign that seeks to boost college completion rates in the United States over the next decade.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">As an example, one of the key – and most valuable -- elements of the MoveED website, which was created and is operated by the Indiana-based Lumina Foundation, </span><a style="color: #1155cc;" href="http://moveed.org/network-map/" target="_blank">is a map</a><span style="color: #222222;"> that lists nearly 3,000 groups working around the country to increase the percentage of Americans who enter and graduate from college. The map provides an easy way for everyone from activists to parents to connect with each other and share information and plot joint activities.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">“One of the challenges for people who are working to boost college completion rates is knowing who else is doing the same work and where to find them. With our map, we can show people right down to the street level in individual communities who else is doing that work,” says Teresa Detrich, Strategy Lead for MoveED and Strategy Director, Lumina Foundation.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screenshot-2014-10-01-08.45.24-e1412168103137.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-3218 size-medium" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screenshot-2014-10-01-08.45.24-e1412168103137-251x300.png" alt="" width="251" height="300" /></a><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Detrich adds that the map has proved far more successful than anything she and her colleagues have tried before as part of ongoing attempts to create a network of people who are committed to helping reach the goal of 60 percent of Americans obtaining a high-quality postsecondary degree or credential by 2025, otherwise known as “Goal2025.”</span>

<span style="color: #222222;">MoveEd grows out of other work the foundation has been doing since 2009 to address lagging college graduation rates in the United States. According to the foundation, rates haven’t budged beyond 40 percent since the 1940s, despite the changing demands of the workplace that put people with only high school degrees at a distinct disadvantage.</span>
<blockquote><em><span style="color: #222222;">We’re making it easy for people to find what they need by helping them cut through all the confusing clutter that’s out there.</span></em></blockquote>
<span style="color: #222222;">While also addressing the challenge of boosting graduation rates on other fronts—such as working with policy makers, education officials, colleges and universities and others—Lumina hit upon the idea for MoveEd as a way to harness the power of the people working on the issue in communities across the nation. The site launched last Spring.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">In addition to the map, which provides ways to find and connect people with each other, MoveED also functions like an information marketplace. The site is filled with what are called “<a href="http://moveed.org/ideas-action/" target="_blank">ideas and actions</a>” – articles, toolkits, research and other resources that groups working to boost college graduation rates can share or use to inform their own activities.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">“We’re making it easy for people to find what they need by helping them cut through all the confusing clutter that’s out there,” Detrich adds.</span>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This post originally appeared on the <a href="Post%20originally published on http://douglasgould.com/blog" target="_blank">Douglas Gould and Company blog.</a></em>

Think back to the exact moment when you decided to become an activist.
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Go ahead. We’ll wait.
<span id="more-1441"></span>
Was it…</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Because someone sent you a petition?
Or because a friend forwarded you an advocacy alert?
Or, I know: was it because you read a <em>really great </em>white paper?</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Chances are, none of these inspired you to become an activist. So why do advocacy organizations persist in using these approaches?</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">The answer is: they are safe and tested. They generate the kinds of measurable returns that professionals love to see. And they are not likely to end in a spectacular failure.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;"><a href="http://artisticactivism.org/people/about-the-founders/" target="_blank">Steve Lambert</a> and <a href="http://artisticactivism.org/people/about-the-founders/" target="_blank">Stephen Duncombe</a>, co-founders of the <a href="http://artisticactivism.org/" target="_blank">Center for Artistic Activism</a>, want advocates to go out on a limb – not just to <em>involve</em> artists in their campaigns, but to produce campaigns that actually <em>function </em>as art, theater or performance.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">What the heck does that mean? Some examples:</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">When the Open Society Foundation <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #005796;" href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/these-roma-students-make-better-physicians-musicians" target="_blank">wanted to elevate perceptions of Roma health workers Bucharest</a>, they sent young medical students out on public transportation and had them offer free doctor’s visits. Through a public spectacle (involving loud accordions) the campaign flipped existing stereotypes of Roma people as buskers; it presented Roma students not as panhandlers but as health providers and peers.</p>
&nbsp;
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;" align="center"><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/bS3IdTqf2i4??autoplay=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;showsearch=0&amp;vq=hd720" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
&nbsp;
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">When artist Alfredo Jaar wanted to <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #005796;" href="http://www.marthagarzon.com/contemporary_art/2011/01/politics-in-contemporary-art-alfredo-jaar/" target="_blank">highlight the lack of cultural resources in the paper mill town of Skoghall, Sweden</a>, he built them a free museum. He filled it with art created by local children. The opening ceremony was attended by virtually the entire community. After much pomp and circumstance, Jaar informed local residents that tomorrow he would burn the museum to the ground.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Local citizens were outraged. They went to their local government and demanded a change. But it was too late. Officials had already promised to let Jaar torch the beloved, new institution after 24 hours. The lesson? Local residents now understood the value of a civic arts space.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;"><a style="font-weight: bold; color: #005796;" href="http://douglasgould.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jaar-museum.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1442" src="http://douglasgould.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/jaar-museum.jpg" alt="jaar_museum" width="353" height="469" /></a></p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Finally, here’s an example that’s slightly better known. When the mayor of Bogota wanted to reduce traffic fatalities, he didn’t lower the speed limit or issue more tickets. <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #005796;" href="http://freakonomics.com/2012/06/29/the-traffic-mimes/" target="_blank">He hired mimes as traffic guards</a>. They mocked violators – both aggressive drivers and self-important pedestrians – and cut death rates in half. The idea has since caught on in a number of other Latin American cities.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Want more case studies of creative activism? An impressive selection has been compiled on the website <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #005796;" href="http://actipedia.org/" target="_blank">Actipedia.org</a>. Lambert and Duncombe stress that none of these campaigns will likely work outside of their specific context. However they can certainly inspire a new way of thinking about advocacy.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">Another resource for imaginative social good campaigns is: <a style="font-weight: bold; color: #005796;" href="http://www.weforum.org/best-practices/creative-good/" target="_blank">Creative4Good.org</a>, a site I helped to launch last year with the Ad Council and the World Economic Forum. This substantial database of global case studies can be searched by region and subject matter and includes samples of creative materials.</p>
<p style="color: #3e3e3e;">When looking at these campaigns, you may think: my Executive Director would <em>never </em>go for that. To this, Lambert offer constructive advice: consider your advocacy campaign like an investment portfolio. Spend some money on the tried and true advocacy methods – the marches, email outreach and petitions. But reserve some of your budget for experimentation. Take risks. Do something that’s not been done before. And don’t be afraid of failure.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lessons From A Really Slick Campaign to Save The Arctic</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the years, the activist group <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/" target="_blank">Greenpeace</a> has relied on blockades on the high seas and protests on land to push its environmental agenda. More recently, Greenpeace also demonstrated how it's successfully using social media to put the blocks to companies whose practices need to change.

In keeping with the kind of audacity that has characterized some of its past and highly visible “direct action” efforts, Greenpeace last summer posted a video to YouTube that showed a model of the Arctic – made from Lego bricks – being destroyed by an oil spill from Shell Oil Co. rigs and drills. The video was part of a campaign to shame the Danish toymaker into breaking a marketing arrangement with the oil company.

The fact that Lego earlier this month <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/09/lego-ends-shell-partnership-following-greenpeace-campaign" target="_blank">announced</a> plans to sever its 50-year relationship with Shell came as no surprise. The "Everything is NOT awesome" video received over 1 million views just one day after it was posted online. By the time the video had nearly 6 million views, Lego had enough and decided it would no longer sell its toy sets in Shell gas stations in 26 countries.

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/qhbliUq0_r4?autoplay=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;showsearch=0&amp;vq=hd720" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Recently, many businesses, firms and organizations have been using what's known as “brandjacking” - borrowing the elements of another organization's brand to push an agenda. The rise of social media has presented a great opportunity to take advantage of this playful approach.

However, Greenpeace has taken the concept of brandjacking to a whole new level.  Using a cheeky, yet somewhat risky approach, it created a campaign that mimics the brands it is targeting.

“It’s a really easy place for us to operate in,” said Cassady Sharp, an online content creator for Greenpeace. “Go after brands specifically and say you can do better. Your customers want you to do better.”

This sentiment speaks to the overall goal of the "Save the Arctic" campaign. The campaign was not created to start a battle <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2014/10/greenpeace-lego-and-shell">over morality</a>; it was simply a clever political push by an environmental organization to stop further destruction to the Arctic caused by companies drilling for oil.

Despite the success of the campaign, critics have focused on the fact that Lego itself uses oil to produce its products. Perhaps so. But the point of this campaign was different. It was to embarrass Lego and pressure it to break its relationship with Shell, while simultaneously branding the oil company with a very public black eye.

The campaign offers a number of valuable lessons, many of which are summed up in article by Elena Polisano, an Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace UK, that appeared earlier this month in the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/oct/09/lego-ends-shell-partnership-following-greenpeace-campaign" target="_blank">Guardian</a>.

In addition, here are some of my own takeaways about how to apply the lessons of the Greenpeace effort to different types of campaigns, not just environmental ones:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Make some noise.  </strong>Since people are exposed to thousands of messages a day, it has become difficult to grab their attention. You’ve really got to create a campaign that sparks a bit of controversy. For certain issues, this approach is the best way to get people to care. Greenpeace’s take on brandjacking was a drastic way to push two large companies to change their behaviors.</li>
	<li><strong>Don't underestimate your voice.</strong> This goes hand-in-hand with "make some noise." If you have a catchy, controversial, or creative campaign, bets are somebody will take notice. In most cases, it’s the public on blogs and social media. The public outcry will eventually push one party in the situation to make a move.</li>
	<li><strong>Play the cute card.  </strong>Featuring children and animals in your campaign is a no-brainer, especially if the topic relates to either one. If you question the weight of this tactic, just take a look at BuzzFeed Animals or Reddit. The sheer number of articles, videos and pictures should tip you off. Greenpeace recognized the value in this tactic, and <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2014/oct/10/greenpeace-lego-shell-climate-change-arctic-oil" target="_blank">organized</a> a peaceful protest of 50 children outside a London Shell office. The children built larger-than-life Artic animals out of Lego-inspired cardboard bricks.</li>
	<li><strong>Be well rounded. </strong>Today there are so many means to get a message across to your audience. Keeping that in mind, it's important to use different mediums to reinforce your point, especially if it's a big ask. Having that convergence across the board will help you obtain that big goal. Greenpeace is very deliberate in its strategy. By using various social media outlets and creative protests, Greenpeace has been able to achieve those lofty goals.</li>
	<li><strong>Deep pockets don't always get the upper hand. </strong>When taking on a huge corporation, you will almost always be at a disadvantage when it comes to money. Thinking creatively will often level the playing field in these types of situations.</li>
</ul>
For a little more inspiration, here are other examples of how Greenpeace has used brandjacking:

In <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/06/greenpeace-campaign-targets-mattel.html" target="_blank">2011,</a> it launched an anti-deforestation campaign to pressure toy manufacturer Mattel to drop Asia Pulp and Paper as its paper supplier. As part of this effort, Greenpeace staged the breakup of the company's iconic doll couple, Barbie and Ken, by having activists scale Mattel's 15-story headquarters in El Segundo, Calif., and place a giant banner picturing Ken that read, “Barbie, It’s over. I don’t date girls that are into deforestation."

Rewind back two more years, and Trader Joes was cleverly renamed <a href="http://www.traitorjoe.com">“Traitor Joes”</a> because of its purchase of “red-listed” seafood, a practice that was said to be damaging the oceans. A year after the campaign was launched, the grocer changed it policies and promised to only sell sustainable seafood in its stores.

Calling out large corporations is easy. Getting enough people to care and demand action is another story. Greenpeace has identified a sweet spot for turning attention to problematic corporate social responsibility.

By conducting research and measuring the reaction to its campaigns, Greenpeace discovered that its audience responds really well to this mischievous approach.

“Make something that can sometimes be really depressing, like environmental issues, just a little bit more fun and playful and hopefully that makes people more engaged and inspired by the content, “ said Sharp. “We typically see this over and over again with these campaigns. People like the playfulness and feel more inspired to do something.”]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Reaching The Caring Middle, One Emerald Lawn At A Time</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Drive an hour south of Gainesville and you'll come to The Villages, the world's largest retirement community. Sprawling across four Florida counties, the community is irresistible fodder for journalists who like to parachute down to the neat cul-de-sacs, golf greens and Zumba classes here. The Villages lends a regular dateline for national and international stories on how these rolling hills now sprout the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-06-27/fastest-growing-metro-area-in-u-s-has-no-crime-or-kids.html">fastest-growing metro area in America</a>, or about the lack of crime, or, especially popular, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2657325/Ten-women-man-black-market-Viagra-thriving-swingers-scene-Welcome-The-Villages-Florida-elderly-residents-Sex-Square-cocktail-honor-woman-68-arrested-public-sex-toyboy.html">the sexual proclivity of residents</a>, as if it’s novel for retirees to pop Viagra and hook-up.

I also parachute into The Villages every few years, but not to report on the sex or the sprawl. For my work as an environmental journalist, the 110,000 residents here represent a growing audience as well as a demographic I’ve come to think of as the “Caring Middle.” The Caring Middle is made up of large numbers of Americans – in both political parties or neither – who care deeply about the trajectory of our country, their fellow humans and the environment. But there’s little or no climate-change news in <a href="http://www.thevillagesdailysun.com/">their local newspaper</a>. They tune out partisan yelling on TV and radio. They spend their time on tennis rather than Twitter.

I first spoke at the largest retirement community on the planet seven years ago, after a resident named Sue Michalson heard me on NPR talking about my first book, <em>Mirage.</em> Back then, Michalson, a retired interior and floral designer from Westchester County, N.Y., had the emerald-green lawn iconic to The Villages, well-irrigated and fertilized. She did not know about the direct connection between her hose and the aquifer, or her fertilizer and Florida’s freshwater. The essential truth of the Caring Middle is this: Once they know, they care.

[caption id="attachment_4415" align="alignleft" width="334"]<img class="wp-image-4415" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Yard-After-Conversion-West-Side-30Oct2014-300x194.jpg" alt="Yard After Conversion West Side 30Oct2014" width="334" height="216" /> Villages residents Steve and Susan Turnipseed have torn out 5,000 square feet of turf grass and and replaced it with more than 100 species of natives to both reduce water use and provide habitat to wildlife. Between the “Florida-Friendly” landscaping, rain barrels and a switch from overhead sprinklers to drip irrigation, the couple’s water use has dropped from 25,000 gallons to 3,000 gallons in three years.[/caption]

When I made a return visit last week to talk about my book <em>Blue    </em><em>Revolution</em>, Michalson’s yard had become a mosaic of beautiful river rock. She hadn’t irrigated or splashed a drop of fertilizer in years. The environmental club she founded – The Village Greens – had successfully lobbied the community for reclaimed water. The club now offers courses in rainwater catchment and leads residents on tours of sustainable building design.

Environmental reporters are good at preaching to the choir, and I do too much of it: Speaking about my books to organizations that already work on water; writing for my own favorite environmental magazines such as <a href="http://ensia.com/features/hey-america-its-time-to-talk-about-the-price-of-water/">Ensia</a> and <a href="http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/7586">Orion</a>; engaging on social media with followers who well grasp the threats of climate change and water scarcity and pollution. But these fragmented channels cut us off from many audiences whose numbers, cultural influence and political clout put them in the best position to help tip the United States toward a more sustainable future.

We know from network theory that most people are “conditional cooperators” – going along with new norms and truths if they see enough of their neighbors going along. So the work of a couple I met last week, Steve and Susan Turnipseed, to rip out 5,000 square feet of turf to restore native vegetation in a community as grass-obsessed as The Villages will do more to save the aquifer in this part of the world than 100 preachy press releases. Talking to neighbors about the impact of fossil fuels on climate change in a retirement community as big, conventional and fuel-dependent as The Villages makes Sue Michalson a more powerful force for change in her circles than Naomi Klein, whose audiences already agree with what she says, in hers.

The lesson for social-change communicators is to meet the Caring Middle on their own (sustainable) turf. The most surprising place my water and climate reporting has taken me is the pulpit – preaching not to the choir, but to the Caring Middle in their places of worship. My books have been part of a <a href="http://67.225.131.93/webinar/blue_revolution">nationwide read</a> by Unitarian Universalist congregations; <a href="http://www.beacon.org/Assets/PDFs/BlueRevolutiondg.pdf">a Christian reader’s guide</a>; and an <a href="http://ichetuckneealliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WaterEthicForInterfaithFinal.pdf">interfaith guide </a>to water. This fall, at the Society of Environmental Journalists’ annual conference in New Orleans, a group of us met for a <a href="http://www.sej.org/initiatives/sej-annual-conferences/AC2014-agenda-friday#BEATDINNERS?utm_source=announcement+of+beat+dinner+signups&amp;utm_campaign=AC14+attendees&amp;utm_medium=email">beat dinner</a> with religious leaders to discuss whether faith may work where science and politics have failed to draw the Caring Middle to stem environmental injustice, pollution and climate change.

Not as salacious as sex among retirees, but a far less predictable story – one that just might help save the planet.

		<title>The King Of Social Change Communicators</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for his legendary work as a leader, activist and humanitarian.

King, however, should also be remembered as one of the most effective public interest communicators of our time. Richard Lischer, author of “The Preacher King: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Word that Moved America,” writes, “[King] practiced the creativity of a preacher and a poet. He had the preacher’s (and actor’s and politician’s) knack of translating every stray piece of information into the dramatic communication of ideas. Although he was a shrewd social strategist, his genius was poetic in nature, for he had the prophet’s eye for seeing local injustices in light of transcendent truths.”

King’s success can be seen in his ability to create and deliver messages and organize people to address society’s injustices. Many of his strategies are used today by social change communicators.

One prominent example is the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycotts in 1965 through 1966, which brought King to national attention for the first time. The idea for the boycotts came from Jo Ann Robinson, a leader in Montgomery’s Women’s Political Council. The idea came to her in 1950, and in 1954, she wrote the mayor and hinted that if bus drivers didn’t start to treat black riders differently, black riders would respond with a boycott.

The night Rosa Parks was arrested, Robinson mimeographed more than 50,000 copies of a flier urging blacks riders to stay off the bus. The one-day boycott was so effective that the community voted to extend the boycott and elected the 26-year-old King as their leader.

As the boycott went on, the nonviolent protests paved the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1956 declaring segregation of public buses unconstitutional.

King and the other organizers relied on a strategy key to any successful public interest communication effort: highlighting something morally wrong and then creating a compelling call to action that forces others to take notice. From a tactical perspective, King and his fellow organizers were also wise to use the boycotting technique because of the economic pain it caused the bus company and other businesses in the city. And in an era in which Americans were turning to television for theirs news, the footage of thousands of people walking to work created great visuals that worked well for television.

As an orator, King also left his mark. Few speeches delivered before or since have the extraordinary resonance of his speech on the National Mall on Aug. 28, 1963.

His words that day still soar:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <em>I say to you today, my friends. And so, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> </em><em>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: </em><em>‘</em><em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.</em><em>’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> </em><em>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I have a dream today!</em></p>
King didn’t have a screen or a powerpoint presentation, but his visual language spoke to American values and history. Science now tells us that our brains retain messages that invoke images and stories that speak to our values and culture.

Over time, King used his understanding of how to gain media coverage to help sway public opinion. Probably the best-recorded examples (and the subjects of an academy award-nominated film) were three marches organized in Selma, Ala., to address voter repression in the South.

The marches from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery took place in March of 1965. Although the first two marches were stopped before reaching Montgomery, the television coverage of Alabama state troopers brutally beating the marchers galvanized the public.

Finally, on March 21, 1965, King and other civil rights leaders led 2,000 people on their third, successful march to Montgomery. This time, the Alabama National Guard, under orders from President Lyndon B. Johnson, protected the protesters.

Over the course of the three marches, black voter disenfranchisement in the South became a topic of national conversation and led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guaranteed the right to vote for all black Americans, because King was able to connect an abstract topic—disenfranchised black voters—with powerful visuals.

“King was a master manipulator of media,” says civil rights expert Travis Atria, “He was very careful about which causes he put his weight behind, because he knew that Selma wasn't just Selma… These were chances to communicate the evils of racism and segregation to the entire world. There's a famous story during the march on Selma where a Life Magazine photographer put down his camera to help a marcher who was being beaten by police. King saw it, took the cameraman aside and told him, ‘Your role is to photograph what is happening to us.’ He knew that a picture in Life Magazine of a black man being beaten by the cops during a peaceful march would do more to help black people than trying to stop the cop in that particular instance. He wasn't interested in posturing; he was only interested in results.”

King’s effectiveness as a communicator, and that of those with whom he surrounded himself, propelled the civil rights movement forward, and is a potent reminder that even the most seemingly insurmountable problems can be overcome.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many Florida environmentalists woke up this morning with an election hangover from mixed brews: How could things have gone so swimmingly and so badly, all in the same night?

An overwhelming 75 percent of Florida voters supported the Water and Land Conservation Amendment, which will direct $18 billion in existing real estate taxes to environmental protection over the next two decades. At the same time, a slim majority of voters re-elected Governor Rick Scott, who loosened environmental regulations, avoided reporters’ questions on climate change, dismantled Florida’s growth-management system, fired scores of environmental scientists and water managers, and <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/under-scott-department-of-environmental-protection-undergoes-drastic-change/2202776" target="_blank">cut the time to approve a pollution permit to only two days</a>.

One wildlife scientist said he couldn’t sleep with the wondering: How could a number of voters approve of both Amendment 1 and Governor Scott?

The answer is that Amendment 1 – like other water and land measures that passed around the country yesterday – transcended politics. Ever since its conception, that was the idea. “One of the central tenets of our campaign plan was to never let this become partisan – to make sure it could draw the support of Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and Floridians of all political stripes,” campaign manager Will Abberger told me. “We also were very intentional not to make it an issue in the governor’s race. We really wanted to stay above that political fray.”

That’s been the appeal of water and land conservation ever since President Theodore Roosevelt established the nation’s first National Wildlife Refuge at Florida’s Pelican Island in 1903. Then and now, U.S. voters could see clearly beyond party lines to what’s at stake for water, land and wildlife. Americans today find their favorite natural places disappearing. They’re worried about the spread of pollution in our most water-dependent regions such as Florida and the Great Lakes. In California and much of the West, they’re watching water vanish before their very eyes.

On Tuesday, voters across the nation ignored party lines to allocate billions of dollars to the cause. In California, they passed Proposition 1, a $7.5 billion water bond to fund new regional supplies, groundwater pollution cleanup, environmental restoration and community drinking-water projects statewide. In New Jersey, voters said yes to Question 2, a permanent fund for the state to buy and preserve open space.

In contrast, the crucial issues of water-quality regulation at the state and federal levels; growth and land-use; and especially climate change remain not only political, but full of invective on all sides. Seeing prominent environmentalists refer to Governor Scott as Lord Voldemort this election season made me cringe no less than hearing U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio claim on Fox news, “I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate in the way these scientists are portraying it.”

When issues become this politicized and polarized, voters in <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/10/reaching-the-caring-middle-one-emerald-lawn-at-a-time/" target="_blank">America’s vast “Caring Middle”</a> – who gladly transcend party for the highest causes – simply close their ears. In the wake of an election that likely puts the nation’s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inhofe-an-epa-foe-likely-to-lead-senate-environment-committee/2014/11/05/d0b4221e-64f4-11e4-836c-83bc4f26eb67_story.html" target="_blank">most prominent climate-change denier</a> in charge of the U.S. Senate’s environmental committee, it will be more important than ever to take the case directly to the public – to help them hear.

Social-change communicators facing this challenge would do well to get inside the brains of Florida’s <a href="http://voteyeson1fl.org/" target="_blank">“Vote Yes on 1”</a> campaign – Abberger, Pegeen Hanrahan, Aliki Moncrief and Laura Ciociola. Vote Yes on 1 was inspirational, with iconic images of Florida’s wildlife and natural places. It was aspirational, calling Floridians to come together to protect treasures like the Everglades, beaches and springs on behalf of future generations.

It was totally apolitical – asking the best of each of us – and perhaps most importantly, totally positive. Nothing could be more so than in every, last message: YES.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Politics has a way of straining even the closest relationships. A rant on Twitter from a relative can make even the most patient among us decide to stop following that person. But new research suggests that exposure to all of those diverse political views on social media may actually be making us more politically moderate.

For years, in fact, political scientists and media experts have been telling us that social media usage increases political polarization through what they describe as an “echo-chamber” effect – people surround themselves with like-minded connections and end up with a stream of comments, shares and tweets that sound remarkably like their own.

That may be true for the people we’re closest to on social networks, but “these sites facilitate exposure to messages from those with whom individuals have weak social ties,” explains <a href="http://pablobarbera.com/" target="_blank">Pablo Barberá</a>, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Politics at New York University. Your best friends may share your political views –that’s part of why you’re close –but you also see tweets from relatives and acquaintances with whom you’re less close and who may have very different political views from you.

To test whether social media can moderate political views, Barberá <a href="https://files.nyu.edu/pba220/public/barbera-polarization-social-media.pdf" target="_blank">undertook a massive study of Twitter users</a> and their networks in Germany, Spain, and the United States. He analyzed the tweets of nearly 200,000 politically engaged Twitter users to see whether “citizens in more diverse discussion networks…[became] more moderate over time.” He also looked at survey data collected in the three countries to further explore the effects of social media usage on political moderation.

He found that seeing a variety of political viewpoints expressed on Twitter made people more politically moderate over time. People with more political diversity in their social network tended to slowly diversify their Twitter feeds even more.

“Since individuals are now inadvertently exposed to the news their friends and acquaintances decide to share,” notes Barberá, "selective exposure to ideologically congenial information decreases.”In other words, you may have followed your cousin’s Twitter feed to see photos of his new baby, but you’re also getting a hefty dose of his economic theories on the side, and you may even follow some of the people he follows as a result of it.

This represents an important change in how we think about political polarization. Because of social media, people are no longer exposed to only actively sought information. “Individuals now have access to a wider span of viewpoints about news events,” Barberá suggests,“and most of this information is not coming through traditional channels but either directly from political actors or through their friends and relatives.”Networks can still be polarized, of course, but letting in even a little diversity tends to lead to more diversity in the future.

For communicators, then, it’s important to remember that more than just your primary audience will see your content. Your content will be shared across these networks of weak ties and will reach people who may not be in your target group politically. Whether to adapt your content to appeal to these connections is up to you, but it’s a choice that should be made strategically.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Do You Know What It Takes To Communicate?  </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A few years ago, a large environmental organizational came to us and asked for help rebranding. The executive director was concerned their target audiences – policymakers, activists and donors – didn’t have a clear sense of their “special sauce.” Every time they talked to these people, the organization got a muddled response about their understanding of who the organization was and what it did.

As a first step, we asked people from different departments and levels to give their quick pitch about the organization. All of the answers were remarkably different. We discovered that instead of a branding problem the organization had an internal communication challenge.

That story isn’t uncommon. Often, organizations aren’t aware of what they don’t know when it comes to communicating effectively.

A nonprofit’s ability to communicate to its most important audiences – whether it is reaching out to policymakers or educating members – is key to helping it identify or fulfill its mission. Too often, organizations don’t take regular stock of their communication practices to determine what they do well and where improvements are needed.

Through our decades of experience we’ve learned a lot of what it takes to make nonprofit organizations effective at using communication. So, to help organizations assess whether they are poised to be communication powerhouses or where they need to make improvements, we created the<a href="http://spitfiresmartscan.org/about" target="_blank"> SmartScan<sup>TM</sup></a>.

This free online tool draws on our years of working with nonprofits and what we learned from focus groups we conducted with leaders from organizations of all sizes. The consensus among focus group participants was that having strong communication capacity within an organization is critical to reach important audiences, including possible donors or members, area residents, even the media, in the right way given limited resources. As one participant from a large nonprofit organization explained, communication capacity is “how able you are to get your message out and how far your reach is.”

Participants also emphasized that a tool to assess communication must factor in efforts to communicate both inside and outside of the organization.

The SmartScan is designed to give an organization an overarching assessment of its communication systems and infrastructure. Users answer a series of questions about current practices and receive a tailored report detailing suggested improvements to their communication program.

The tool comprises four modules – Identity, Planning, Best Practices and Results. Organizations can take them all at once or complete one section at a time. The payoff is a clearer understanding of what the organization is doing well and should keep doing and where more communication capacity or resources will enable it to create a bigger impact.

For example, questions in the Identity section include “Do you have a written style guide to promote consistency?” and “Does your brand identity clarify why you are unique among your peers?” The Best Practices module asks organization to consider questions like, “Do you have a spokesperson (or people) prepared with messages for interviews?” and “Does your organization know what kind of stories it needs to tell to engage important audiences?” Upon completion of a module, participants will receive a tailored report with feedback and recommendations depending on answers to each question.

Organizations who have used the SmartScan have been letting us know what they think – one user noted, “It was a good reminder of everything we need to be doing and it was good to be prompted to check in with fellow staff members on how they’re doing in communicating our brand.”

Many have said that the detailed report was an excellent resource and one of the best parts of the tool. One person articulated, “I liked the explanations – on the questions we did well on, the results were very encouraging; and on the places we could improve, there were concrete suggestions.”

		<title>Have You Heard? We Have A Science Communication Problem.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the wake of recent midterm elections, many worry that science will be downplayed, if not ignored, in upcoming policy debates.

For instance, Republican James Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is slated to be the next head of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, doesn’t believe in climate change and even wrote a book calling global warming a hoax.  The prospect of a global warming denier chairing the Senate's most powerful environmental committee sends chills down the spines of many environmental advocates.

Inhofe, however, is hardly the only member of the new GOP majority in Congress who has little use for science in policy debates. In fact, many Republicans proudly campaigned during the last election claiming they’re “not scientists.”

How is it possible that our elected leaders are so quick to ignore science and push for policy without evidence? Some say it’s because <em>we have a science communication problem.</em>

Whether the issue is climate change, vaccinations or gun control, many public policy debates over the years have ensued without scientific evidence or support. In an article in the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6154/53.full" target="_blank">October 2013 issue of Science</a>, Dan Kahan, the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of Law &amp; Professor of Psychology at Yale Law School, writes that the science communication problem “has been the focus of scientific study since the 1970s, when psychologists began to investigate the divergence between expert and public opinion on nuclear power.”

Kahan believes that by studying past controversies we can learn how to “predict, manage, and in theory avoid conditions likely to trigger” future controversies.

Kahan's Science article, which reviews an effort several years ago to mandate a nationwide immunization program, is both a cautionary tale “about the failure of compelling scientific evidence to resolve public dispute over risks and similar facts” as well as guidance for the future. According to Kahan, the controversy erupted after the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommended in 2006 that all 50 states require that adolescent girls be vaccinated against human papilloma virus (HPV), a sexually transmitted disease that causes cervical cancer.

The recommendation for the nationwide HPV immunization program followed FDA approval earlier that year for Gardasil, a drug produced by Merck. Because the FDA had "fast-tracked" the drug, it was the first to reach the market. Writes Kahan, “After approval, the company sponsored a nationwide lobbying campaign directed at state legislatures to add the vaccine to the schedule of immunizations required for school enrollment. These were profit-driven choices, aimed at enabling Merck to establish a dominant market position for Gardasil before GlaxoSmithKline could secure approval for its rival product, Cervarix.”

The decision to introduce Gardasil “as a mandatory, girls-only shot for a sexually transmitted disease in a nationwide legislative campaign” was met by serious opposition from conservatives who feared its use would become a license for unsafe sexual behavior and sexual promiscuity.

Opponents campaigned against Gardasil, calling mandatory immunization a slippery slope or hall pass that would permit promiscuity, while proponents tried to use scientific evidence to make their case that the vaccine could prevent cervical cancer.

Media coverage played up the cultural divide, further fueling the controversy with stories like this one in the New York Times: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/06/health/06seco.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;" target="_blank">A Vital Discussion, Clouded</a>." The article described how "worries about promiscuity have clouded the discussion about the cervical cancer vaccine that was approved last year for girls and young women."

A <a href="http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1206813,00.html" target="_blank">Time magazine article</a> cited a comment that the Family Research Council's Bridget Maher made to The New Scientist in which she warned that “giving the HPV vaccine to young women could be potentially harmful, because they may see it as a license to engage in premarital sex." That same article quoted Reginald Finger, a former medical advisor to Focus on the Family and member of the CDC advisory committee, who had told The Hill earlier that "if people begin to market the vaccine or tout the vaccine that this makes adolescent sex safer, then that would undermine the abstinence-only message."

These arguments were counter to recommendations from public health professionals who argued "the vaccines generally work best when everyone gets them: the laws of 'herd immunity' dictate that the more people are protected against a particular virus, the more likely it is to eventually disappear altogether... By vaccinating children before they are sexually active, there is a hope of dramatically reducing the prevalence of at least some strains for the next generation." Those favoring the immunization program also repeatedly pointed out that there was no evidence that the vaccine would increase promiscuous behavior. Due to opposition, the effort to mandate vaccinations eventually was blocked by legislatures in all but one state.

Could this story turned out differently? As he notes in his Science article, Kahan thinks there's a strong possibility of that.

"If Gardasil had not been fast-tracked, the FDA would have approved both Gardasil and Cervarix for boys and girls only three years later. At that point, both vaccines would have become available immediately even without mandates through private insurance and a host of programs designed to assure universal access to childhood vaccines," he writes.

Kahan says the failure to win support for HPV vaccination is part of "a dynamic known as 'cultural cognition,'" which he has been studying for several years at Yale. <a href="http://www.culturalcognition.net/" target="_blank">On a website dedicated to his work</a>, Kahan describes cultural cognition as "the tendency of individuals to conform their beliefs about disputed matters of fact (e.g. whether global warming is a serious threat, whether the death penalty deters murder or whether gun control makes society more safe or less) to values that define their cultural identities," regardless of what science might say. More to the point, when confronted with information that might challenge their cultural identity, individuals will avoid scientific evidence to protect their sense of identity.

How do we overcome some people's resistance to science? How do we get people to accept what the science tells us?

Citing again from Kahan's Science article, he believes the answer rests with developing "evidence-informed risk communication strategies," or strategies that frame the science as a rational choice. By framing science-based issues in such a way, perhaps we can get people to see that their cultural identities are not threatened, but that the suggested solution or recommendation is the wisest course of action.

In an earlier article that appeared in Nature in 2010, Kahan wrote, "It would not be a gross simplification to say that science needs better marketing. Unlike commercial advertising, however, the goal of these techniques is not to induce public acceptance of any particular conclusion, but rather to create an environment for the public's open-minded, unbiased consideration of the best available scientific information."]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ll admit it. I’m obsessive.

Not about everything, but unabashedly so about things that matter.

Among them: frank and its mission.

So, the other day when someone asked me to summarize in less than 10 words what frank does, I said we:
<blockquote>Obsessively connect people who speak for the greater good.</blockquote>
It’s a simple mission. Focused. Direct. Free of ambiguity. And fueled by passion.

But that’s not all.

As part of our effort to make the good greater, we also <em>obsessively </em>connect people working in the field of social change communications to discoveries. Findings from research. Lessons learned from practice. Wisdom gleaned from doing this work day after day.

Our commitment to frank’s mission is reflected in everything we do. On our website. In our annual gatherings. In helping to foster connections among smart and committed people.

If you are already part of our community, we are so glad to have you. If you see yourself and your mission in this community, you belong. And if you are obsessive about the chance to make the good greater, don’t be shy about that.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lifting People Out of Poverty Is Tough Enough. The Wrong Words Make It Harder.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently spent the day with intelligent and earnest foundation leaders in child and family advocacy. They create and implement national programs to reduce poverty for families with children. I had to cajole, shame and plead with them to stop saying they were “incubating innovative reforms” and “providing supports for parents.”

Let’s be clear: I am fully committed to these activities, as are they.

But here’s the rub. When you tell a room full of community leaders, funders, program providers or just regular people these very words, you run some major risks. You might:

a. Cause their eyes to glaze over
b. Reinforce that nothing will change
c. Confuse and alienate them
d. Trigger a hostile response

“Reform” tells people the work of alleviating poverty is broken. “Incubating” is creepy when applied to people and conjures images of babies in incubators. When paired with “innovative” – which may be the most tired word of 2014 – it’s redundant. Typical foundation-speak turns most people off. I am in no way the first communications pro to point this out, but I fear we’re not making headway.

Here is how I know this. I had the opportunity to lead a year-long message research project in partnership with the <a href="http://www.aecf.org/" target="_blank">Annie E. Casey Foundation</a> and <a href="http://globalstrategygroup.com/" target="_blank">Global Strategy Group</a><a href="http://www.globalstrategygroup.com/" target="_blank">.</a> We interviewed people inside the foundation, their peers and experts outside the foundation, and we read everything we could get our hands on, including multiple studies our colleagues have conducted on the same issue. We held four focus groups in Dallas and Baltimore – a “red” city and a “blue” one – and asked them if poverty was a problem and what, if anything, could be done about it. We listened to the voices of average Americans, and we learned from them. Then just to be sure their opinions were typical, we conducted a nationally representative sample of 1001 Americans.

Talking poverty is a minefield. Meanwhile, program staff and foundation leaders sound like academics, using language that turns off civilians. It may be true that to lift families out of poverty we need to “support the whole family,” but national data tells us that is not what the majority of Americans say they want.

Three out of four Americans say they believe that “those born into poverty can still be successful if they’re determined and willing to work hard.” But we learned there are winning ways to engage policymakers, influencers and other public audiences.

Here are some ways to talk solutions.

Avoid using these terms to introduce a conversation, even with potential advocates:

“Giving families the resources they need”
“In need,” “disadvantaged,” or “less fortunate”
“Financial security” or ”success”
“Economic mobility” or “independence”
“Work ethic”
“Supporting families”

Our research suggests that some phrases resonate better. Stay true to your mission and work, but to avoid conflict and confusion, try to use these terms where possible:

“Giving families the tools they need”
“Low-income”
“Financial stability”
“Economic opportunity”
“Reduce parents’ stress”
“Personal responsibility”
“Strengthening families”

If we want to get anywhere, we have to start speaking plain English and using real-world examples. We will not sway public opinion by continuing to talk about “services, supports and programs.” Many have empathy for kids, but they really don’t for the adults. They want parents to lift themselves out of poverty for the benefit of their own children.

If you don’t believe that the jargon is hurting us, consider some other gems from our training: “Children live in the context of families.” Why not just say children live in families? “We partner with placed-based providers.” Huh? Must you use “partner” as a verb, and do you seriously expect anyone to know what a “placed-based provider” is?!?

Let’s talk about helping people get the skills they need to get a better job. Policies that help working parents keep more of what they earn. Offering opportunities for all people to achieve financial stability for their families. The bottom line is that our job as communicators is to always simplify and clarify. Ours is a battle against complication and confusion. Poverty is nuanced and complicated enough.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This post is modified from a version that originally appeared on the Philanthropy New York web site <a href="https://philanthropynewyork.org/news/moment-i-lost-it" target="_blank">here</a>.</em>

<strong>by Michael Hamill Remaley</strong>

For a guy like me who treasures the rational decision-making process, information is crucial and feelings are generally irrelevant. But I was surprised to find myself experiencing a surge of emotion during a recent discussion focused on the Common Core teaching standards.

The event, which I'd helped organize, was the second of three “Listening Sessions” <a href="https://philanthropynewyork.org/" target="_blank">Philanthropy New York</a> has been holding this year for education practitioners – principals, superintendents and leaders of education support organizations – along with funders and leaders from the New York City Department of Education, part of long-term multi-funder collaborative the <a href="http://edfundersresearch.org/" target="_blank">Education Funders Research Initiative</a>.  This last session provided an opportunity for education practitioners to hear from a national expert – Linda Darling-Hammond, Faculty Director of the Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education – and local peers about the challenges and opportunities of applying Common Core standards to teaching and learning. In some ways, the education practitioners in the room are the real experts because they are living the reality of education reform every day.

I, on the other hand, have been on the periphery of education reform for over a decade. I became aware of the development of the Common Core standards when I was still running communications for Public Agenda in 2007, which was doing a lot of public engagement work around the country on a variety of education topics. My current job requires me to keep up on education reform topics, but I am anything but an expert.

I know just enough to be jaded. Darling-Hammond spoke about how Common Core standards are intended to improve the way kids think critically and apply a broad range of learning skills to develop more complex problem solving abilities to be used in college and career. I felt like it was an erudite reading of the situation, but not new information to me. The panel discussion of leading education practitioners that followed was also exceptionally thoughtful, but those educators were ones who had never followed the siren song of rote learning and excessive test prep.

Then, I followed the educators into a break-out session, in which the moderator started by asking the packed room if anyone had immediate reactions to what they’d heard in the preceding hours.  The first person who spoke up said that Darling-Hammond’s overview <em>was the first time she had heard such a clear articulation of what the Common Core is supposed to achieve</em> and how it might actually move teacher and school practices in positive directions toward the kind of learning that students really need. The second person who spoke up said that <em>it was the first time she has heard from other educators about how they are really making Common Core work</em> in their schools and she now better understood the great promise of it all. The third person, the fourth person and the fifth person <em>all talked about how this day was the first time they’d heard discussion of the Common Core in ways that would help them move it forward in their own practice.</em>

And that’s when the tears started to well up in my eyes. How could this be? How could I – so much on the periphery of education reform –feel like I’d heard it all before, and those who are living education reform every day feel like they’re hearing the Common Core discussion in a positive and meaningful way for the first time? What is wrong with our system that these immensely important people – and frankly, just a tiny fraction of the education community – are just now having the opportunity have this conversation? What could we as communicators have done differently to make sure that the important messages about Common Core were being heard by those who need this information the most?

I was simultaneously overwhelmed with sadness that there are not more resources available to make these kinds of conversations happen on a broad basis and filled with immense pride that I was a small part of making this one day’s dialogue happen.

I sat in the corner quietly and wiped a tear from my eye while I tried to disguise this fact by blowing my nose. I pulled myself together pretty quickly, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot over the past week.

My work as a communicator, like many others who do similar work, sometimes takes a back seat to the tedium of emails, seemingly endless meetings, dry reports and more panel discussions than I can count.

Occasionally, though, I am reminded that this work does make a difference--even if it takes longer than we'd like.  And sometimes that revelation reduces you to sniveling in the corner of a crowded meeting room.  And that’s a good day.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Michael - With all due respect, you did not "lose it" and you were not "sniveling in the corner."  You were momentarily overwhelmed with a rush of conflicting feelings -- sadness and joy -- the understandable outcome of which is you were moved to shed tears.  I don't think people in professional communications positions are precluded from experiencing genuine emotion privately or, on occasion, publicly.  I once was deeply touched when the chair of the board of The Boston Foundation in the 1980s, Dwight Allison, spoke to a group of us junior community foundation types and unabashedly, while sharing the joy of the caring work he'd been able to accomplish through his role at the foundation, interrupted himself and wept for a moment through the words he was using to express himself.  The moment left an indelible impression on me, on all of us: a grown man, an accomplished adult, a powerful civic force unashamed to let us know that words alone failed to express what he wanted so badly to convey.  We should all feel so strong and so free.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Quantity vs. Quality Measures: Which Matters Most in Communications?</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/12/quantity-vs-quality-measures-which-matters-most-in-communications/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This is a modified version of a post that originally appeared on the Prichard Communications web site <a href="http://prichardcommunications.com/blog/strategic-communications/quantity-vs-quality-measures-matters-communications/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em>

I attended a conference last month at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, where we discussed, among other things how to measure the impact of communications. The meeting kicked off with a slide that read:
<blockquote> <em>The only time you can honestly know you’ve delivered your message is when you hear it back from the audience. Not necessarily in the words you used, but with the core message intact…Your audience has taken what you have to say, internalized it and made it part of their own thinking. That is success in communications.</em></blockquote>
While this isn’t a ground-breaking approach to measuring communications success, I think it’s an important principle to keep in mind—and one that we often forget when messaging the value of our communications programs to internal and external stakeholders.

<strong>The Value of Qualitative Data
</strong>
Instead of bragging about qualitative value like that referenced in the slide, we often default to the hard stuff—the quantitative data… the tangible, gripable, braggable numbers that support our work.

Those numbers are meaty. We can chew on them like a delicious, juicy hamburger. We can dress them up and package them neatly…between the two sides of a fresh, hot Kaiser roll.

I get it.

We humans really like numbers. Psychology Today, says we’re “<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201109/7-reasons-we-7-reasons" target="_blank">obsessed</a>” with them, in fact. Think about it—numbers rule our lives… we use them to set an alarm clock, manage our finances, measure recipes.

Numbers make our life easier in many ways.

Numbers are important.

<strong>The Value of Quantitative Data</strong>

But, numbers don’t always tell the whole story like qualitative data.

Qualitative data, often more art than science, paints a bigger picture—a sometimes abstract, impressionistic picture—of how we’re doing—how well our efforts are paying off.

This picture might be murky—it might be anecdotal. We might not be able to neatly plug it into a spreadsheet—and you number collectors of the world really don’t like things you can’t plug into a spreadsheet. I know because I am one of you.

Qualitative data forces us to take a kind of leap of faith that we are correct in connecting the dots between our work and the real life action our target audiences take. Actions they take that might not always have numbers attached to them. Like the slide references…actions that don’t spit our message back at us—but rather spit a version of our message back… as translated by the various receivers of that message.

<strong>Success Beyond the Numbers</strong>

If you’re using communications to help you effect significant change that will be seen for generations—the qualitative information you collect might end up helping you measure real success considerably more than real numbers.

In essence, qualitative data is the figurative sum of our numbers, our efforts—it’s the whole of our parts… the cumulative taste of all those ingredients we put into that cake we baked.

Qualitative data allows us to measure the real life impact of what we do: how people perceive us in their own words, our message pull-through. It allows us a glimpse into what all those numbers add up to. It helps us build a narrative—and, ultimately, a story—about our hard work.

I’m not arguing against quantitative data—don’t get me wrong. Quantitative data has a significant role in building and measuring communications objectives, motivating us to keep going, and, of course, it makes our number-loving, human hearts really happy.

I’m simply encouraging you to look at the WHOLE picture—the anecdotes, the stories, and the way our messages are being pulled through—before deeming your communications efforts successful or not.

As well-known storytelling expert Andy Goodman has been known to say: “<em><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com/resources/newsletters/give-the-people-what-they-want-a-story/" target="_blank">No one ever marched on Washington because of a pie-chart</a>.”</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>When The Truth Hurts</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the occupational hazards of working in the field of social change communications is that sudden slap in the face that comes when you discover that some lies and falsehoods are immune to the truth.

Argue until you are blue in the face, marshal every scrap of evidence at your disposal, there still are some times you just can't win even when the facts are on your side.

Probably no one is better able to articulate that sad but undeniable truth than <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~nyhan/" target="_blank">Brendan Nyhan</a>, an assistant professor in the Department of Government at Dartmouth College. Nyhan, <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/2015-speakers/" target="_blank">one of the speakers appearing at frank 2015</a>, specializes in researching why misperceptions -- especially in politics and health care -- are so hard to combat.

I'm sure he gets no joy sticking that fact to us, but <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X14015424" target="_blank">his most recently published study</a> offers yet another example. Writing in the December 2014 journal Vaccine, Nyhan and co-author Jason Reifler, a senior lecturer of politics at the University of Exeter, find that telling people there's nothing to fear about flu vaccines -- that they don't make you sick -- is not likely to get them rushing to their doctor or local pharmacy to get immunized.

Noting that "seasonal influenza is responsible for thousands of deaths and billions of dollars of medical costs" in the United States annually, they write that "influenza vaccination coverage remains substantially below public health targets." They also suggest that a "possible obstacle to greater immunization rates is the false belief that it is possible to contract the flu from the flu vaccine." In fact, they point out that more than four in ten Americans, or 43 percent believe the myth that the flu vaccine can give you the flu.

For their study, Nyhan and Reifler provided participants with information from the Centers for Disease Control website explaining that you can't catch the flu from either a flu shot or nasal spray. Afterward they discovered two things:

--First, people were less likely to believe that the vaccine causes the flu.
--Second, they were even less likely to say they were inclined to get immunized.

Commenting on the study, Nyhan said the "findings suggest that corrective information can successfully reduce false beliefs about vaccines. However, that corrective information may unfortunately cause people with fears about side effects to bring those other concerns to mind and thereby reduce their intention to vaccinate."

He adds, "We need to learn how to most effectively promote immunization. Directly correcting vaccine myths may not be the most effective approach."

		<title>5 Rules for Constructive Outrage on Social Media</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/12/5-rules-for-constructive-outrage-on-social-media/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color: #222222;"><em>A modified version of this post originally appeared <a href="http://www.waingergroup.com/our-blog/communications-planning/corporate-communications/5-rules-for-constructive-outrage-on-social-media" target="_blank">here</a>.</em></p>
Elizabeth Lauten, formerly the communications director for Rep. Stephen Lee Fincher (R-Tenn.), is the latest casualty of nasty and thoughtless social media postings.  Her Facebook post criticizing the Obama daughters’ fashion choices during the Thanksgiving turkey pardoning demonstrated a lack of communications savvy in the extreme.  She had ventured into forbidden territory—attacking the first children.  One hopeful sign amid all the partisanship in Washington is that both sides agree the minor offspring of politicians are off limits.

Lauten’s quick resignation is yet another cautionary tale about social media.  It’s breathtakingly easy when you are sitting alone in front of the screen to write what you feel. That’s because there isn’t anyone directly in front of you reacting to your words and expressing joy or horror.  It’s also easy to forget that once those words are out there in the ether, they have a way of haunting your reputation like a creepy ghost.  If Harold Ramis were still with us, would he invent “Postbusters” to clear out all those never-say-die social media atrocities?

There is a difference between an honest engagement in constructive dialogue—which may even become heated—and the tossing of verbal bombs that are not only hurtful but fail to move anything forward.

And Lauten’s story isn’t the only cause for concern.  Take a look at the fastballs heating up social media in the wake of news developments from Ferguson, New York, Cleveland, and Los Angeles. Thoughtful expressions of outrage are healthy and necessary. But justice is never served when sense and sensitivity have been kicked to the curb.

If you’re fuming at injustice or wrong-doing, angry at an acquaintance, outraged by political behavior, or frustrated by a big bureaucracy, here are some tips on how to share your thoughts in a constructive way:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Think about what is really bothering you.</strong> Don't like how a company is behaving? Tell them. I did that recently and got a quick response on Twitter.  The blogosphere, however, is filled with vitriol that rises to the level of death threats.  That’s just plain wrong—and so misguided that it fails to help you or anyone else.</li>
	<li> <strong>Apply the “Get-Up-and-Walk-Around Rule.”</strong>  Before sending your post, get up, leave your screen, and walk around for at least 10 minutes.  When you come back, see if what you wrote is really what you want to say and how you want to say it.</li>
	<li> <strong>Put the “Jumbotron Rule” into play. </strong>Would you want to see your words and your picture show up on the jumbotron at your favorite sporting event or concert?   If not, hit delete.</li>
	<li><strong>Accept the consequences.</strong>  If you still decide to throw your verbal Molotov cocktail, be prepared for the consequences—like loss of friends, job, or reputation. And if it comes down to it, don’t play the blame game.  Be accountable for your words</li>
	<li><strong>Don’t Count on an Apology as a Big Fix.</strong> If you do end up hurting someone else—whether it’s their feelings or reputation or something more dire—don’t expect that just saying you’re sorry will make it all better.  Apologies are important, but they don’t erase pain that’s already been inflicted. And if you have done serious damage, saying you are sorry is like using a fire extinguisher to contain a four-alarm inferno.  Much more than issuing an apology, you’ll need to engage in a frank conversation or more.  And you must show by your actions that you really do feel badly and regret what you said.</li>
</ul>
We need our social media to be powerful tools for commanding attention to injustice, expressing outrage and demanding change.  But the pen (or in this case, the keystroke) really can be mightier than the sword.  And the brief pause for thoughtful consideration—before engaging in a rant—is priceless.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Batman on His 75th Year of Busting Crime (and Gay Rumors)</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Did you know it’s the year of <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.dccomics.com/characters/batman" target="_blank">Batman</a>?

The Caped Crusader has been around as a <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2014/03/27/warner-bros-entertainment-and-dc-entertainment-celebrate-batmans-75th-anniversary" target="_blank">fictional character for 75 years</a>. Originally created in 1939, Batman (or “<a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.comicvine.com/batman/4005-1699/" target="_blank">the Bat-Man</a>,” as he was first known) was a response to National Publications—which later became much better known as <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.dccomics.com/" target="_blank">DC Comics</a>—needing more superhero titles. Superman had hit prime time a year earlier, and National knew it was on to a <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2014/07/captain-america-comics-patriotism-history/" target="_blank">winning formula with costumed heroes</a>, a theme comic book publishers have explored endlessly since.

I have to admit--I’m not much for superheroes. I don’t say this out of snobbery or as an attempt to be indie-er than thou; <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2013/09/on-fathers-and-sons-and-alexander-the-great/" target="_blank">superheroes are just not what I write</a>, nor what I generally read. Much work has been done around superheroes in the comics industry, so much that the two are hard to separate. Some of it is profoundly interesting and much of it resulted in genuinely iconic characters. I’ve had my flirtations with a mutant title or two. But superheroes, for all of how much I get how they happened and why they’re around, never held my interest for long. There are only so many narrative possibilities, even in the hands of those gifted at the craft.

But no one can deny the significance of the Batman mythos in our culture. He was one of the earliest superheroes, to be sure, and in the seven and a half decades since his creation, has been interpreted, reinterpreted, deconstructed and reinterpreted again. He’s been <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_in_film" target="_blank">played on screen</a> by everyone from <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000474/" target="_blank">Michael Keaton</a> (a risky choice if ever there was one) to <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000123/" target="_blank">George Clooney</a>, directed by <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2014/08/batman-dc-comics-75-gay-superhero/www.imdb.com/name/nm0000318/" target="_blank">Tim Burton</a> and <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2014/08/batman-dc-comics-75-gay-superhero/www.imdb.com/name/nm0001708/" target="_blank">Joel Schumacher</a> (and many others), and written by dozens of legendary writers, both on the screen and on the page.

[caption id="attachment_36963" align="alignleft" width="300"]<a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/untitled.jpg"><img class="wp-image-36963 size-medium" src="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/untitled-300x204.jpg" alt="1960s Batman and Robin" width="300" height="204" /></a> Unapologetically campy 1960s TV show[/caption]

The less said of the <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_TV_Show" target="_blank">dreadful Adam West television series</a> the better, but the campy TV version is credited with carrying a comic book character fully into the mainstream, something only a few truly giant titles managed to do by that time. (C’mon, you’ve got the theme song going through your head right now, don’t you? And what other TV shows, about a comic book character or otherwise, featured <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://julienewmar.com/" target="_blank">Julie Newmar</a>, <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.earthakitt.com/ek/" target="_blank">Eartha Kitt</a>, <em>and </em><a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberace" target="_blank">Liberace</a>?) Batman is a character so profoundly soaked into the fabric of this country’s cultural history that I think everything would unravel if you took him away. We’ll never cease to be interested in him.

Meanwhile, Batman has become oddly <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2013/10/the-true-power-of-batman/" target="_blank">relevant to our times</a>, as we think of billionaires, secretive vigilantes and the population of über wealthy people that operate above the law. Bruce Wayne is unquestionably the 1%. We may trust in his motives and ethics, or even trust that he has our best interest at heart, but name one aspect of the character that isn’t a scary tale of wealth abused to work around (though ostensibly somehow in support of) the law.

There’s a whole story behind how and why the character was created, but it’s not nearly as interesting as all the directions he’s gone since. For me, aside from the fact that Batman is just a regular human being, albeit one with tons of money and gadgets, the most intriguing thing is the way in which older, even classical sources were consciously incorporated into the new mythos. Superman is fascinating because much of what’s intriguing about him was almost (we think) subconsciously woven into the story.

With Batman, creators <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kane" target="_blank">Bob Kane</a> and <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Finger" target="_blank">Bill Finger</a> very deliberately pillaged literary characters like the <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scarlet_Pimpernel" target="_blank">Scarlet Pimpernel</a> and <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorro" target="_blank">Zorro</a>. Even the visual aspects of the character pulled from sources like Leonardo Da Vinci. Most of the time, when comic book characters tap into something archetypal, it seems unintentional. However, even the villains in the Batman stories, characters like <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_joker" target="_blank">the Joker</a>, intentionally go much deeper into archetypal darkness than most comics books dare to. The poignancy and violence of Batman’s origin myth—that Bruce Wayne, as a little boy, saw his parents gunned down in front of his eyes and then inherited their vast wealth—is a character study that still <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-psychology-behind-superhero-origin-stories-4015776/?no-ist" target="_blank">intrigues psychologists</a> today.

[caption id="attachment_36964" align="alignright" width="300"]<a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Batbed.png"><img class="wp-image-36964 size-full" src="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Batbed.png" alt="" width="300" height="256" /></a> Notice: no separate bedrooms.[/caption]

The other bit that fascinates me about Batman’s history is his brush with scandal. In 1954, a psychiatrist named <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredric_Wertham" target="_blank">Fredric Wertham</a> published a book—some might say screed—called <em><a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction_of_the_Innocent" target="_blank">Seduction of the Innocent</a>. </em>Wertham didn’t merely target Batman; he denounced Wonder Woman as a lesbian and Superman as an anti-American fascist. Broadly, Wertham’s thesis was about how comics books encouraged every sort of deviance and criminality in young people, and should be, he felt, totally banned.

Wertham’s focus on Batman was specific, in that he found in the stories a bit of what people of his time might have referred to as a “<a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/2014/06/comics-lgbt-pride/" target="_blank">whiff of lavender</a>.” The Batman stories, Wertham insisted, were “psychologically homosexual,” something he felt should be evident to any God-fearing person:
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Only someone ignorant of the fundamentals of psychiatry and of the psychopathology of sex can fail to realize a subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature “Batman” and his young friend “Robin.”</blockquote>
Many feel that Wertham had a bad case of “she doth protest too much,” his rabid pro-American stance a product of his origins in another country (he was born in Germany), and his objections to sex, particularly his fascination with homosexuality, an indication of a suspicious degree of interest in the subject.

<a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/batman_trying_to_sound_gay.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-36965 size-medium" src="http://www.clydefitchreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/batman_trying_to_sound_gay-300x276.jpg" alt="batman_trying_to_sound_gay" width="300" height="276" /></a>In any case, today, Wertham’s sputtering is funny—and yes, perhaps he was just jealous of Bruce Wayne’s glamorous gay life. But sadly, the parents of the 1950s took it all very seriously indeed, and Wertham’s vendetta against comics led to decades of self-censorship by comic book companies (the alternative being direct censorship by the government, after a series of congressional hearings into the causes of juvenile delinquency).

His moral objections and prurient fascination with sex and violence aside, I don’t think Wertham was wrong about there being something rather gay about Bruce Wayne and his alter ego, <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://comicsalliance.com/the-gayness-of-batman-a-brief-history-opinion-morrison/" target="_blank">nor do many others</a>, including a few branches of modern scholarship. <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_morrison" target="_blank">Grant Morrison</a>, one of the most celebrated writers working in the medium (and one of the many who have worked on Batman), said:
<blockquote style="font-style: italic;">Gayness is built into Batman. I’m not using gay in the pejorative sense, but Batman is very, very gay. There’s just no denying it. Obviously as a fictional character he’s intended to be heterosexual, but the basis of the whole concept is utterly gay. I think that’s why people like it.</blockquote>
The homoerotic subtext of Batman and Robin was so blatant that Saturday Night Live parodied it with “<a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ambiguously_Gay_Duo" target="_blank">The Ambiguously Gay Duo</a>,” a long-running animated sketch about a pair of superheroes that go on adventures amidst endless double entendres, riding around in a phallic super-car. As with all parodies that really hit home, the dialogue and imagery isn’t even that far off from the original, particularly the campy 60s TV show. And don’t get me started about the various women introduced into the Batman stories in an attempt to give him a love life. Leave alone the psychological dimensions of so tortured a person plausibly having a relationship with <em>anyone </em>other than his butler and young “ward,” the only two major characters privy to his secret identity. Throwing women into that mess is about as credible as Rock Hudson’s studio-arranged flings.

Do I, as an occasional reader, think there’s something a bit gay about a billionaire adopting a runaway and donning tights with him in a bat cave? Naturally. But what’s really interesting about the Batman mythology is that there’s clearly something far darker than this theme going on. As the Christian Bale once said in an interview, “What kind of guy walks around dressed like a bat?” <a style="color: #73b843;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Miller_(comics)" target="_blank">Frank Miller</a>, another famous writer who once worked on Batman, said, “He’d be <em>much </em>healthier if he were gay.”

Celebrate the year of Batman by delving into any part of this character’s arc—at the very least, it’s good for a snicker or two, but if you dare, the cowled superhero, one of the originals, holds up a very dark mirror to both society and the self.

		<title>Why We’ll All Be Grateful If This Effort Goes Spiral</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In this day and age, where social media dominates so much, we often measure successful outreach as something going viral.

But maybe there's another measure we ought to start paying attention to: something going spiral.

That's a term being introduced in connection with a website, <a href="http://elementofgratitude.org/" target="_blank">ElementofGratitude.org</a>, and which is part of a newly launched initiative of the John Templeton Foundation to encourage people to actively share messages, photos and videos with others -- called  "<a href="http://elementofgratitude.org/create" target="_blank">Gratitude Grams</a>" -- about the things for which they are grateful.

According to the foundation, the goal "is to start a chain reaction across the internet, an online manifestation of the gratitude spiral."  In other words, if one person tells someone else what they're grateful or thankful about  -- family, job or friends, for example -- the hope is the person who hears a message of gratitude will similarly express their thanks to others -- so on and so on.

The underlying purpose of this work draws on scientific studies about the positive effects of gratitude on individuals and societies, which manifests itself in ways such as:
<ul>
	<li>Stronger immune systems and lower blood pressure;</li>
	<li>Higher levels of positive emotions;</li>
	<li>More joy, optimism, and happiness;</li>
	<li>Acting with more generosity and compassion;</li>
	<li>Feeling less lonely and isolated.</li>
</ul>
Dr. Robert Emmons, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Davis, and one of the leading researchers on this topic, says that "gratitude is more than a pleasant feeling; it is also motivating." Emmons says that gratitude "serves as a key link between receiving and giving: It moves recipients to share and increase the very good they have received. Because so much of human life is about giving, receiving, and repaying, gratitude is a pivotal concept for our social interactions." He notes that the famed sociologist Georg Simmel declared "that gratitude is 'the moral memory of mankind.' If every grateful action, he went on to say, were suddenly eliminated, society would crumble." He adds that gratitude is a practice worth promoting because of how it can help strengthen “social ties” and cultivate “an individual’s sense of interconnectedness."

Beyond the Templeton Foundation’s own ElementofGratitude.org, it is also funding organizations and researchers, such as Emmons, who are trying to build more scientific understanding of the role of gratitude in society.  Among the goals of the research and related activities are to:
<ul>
	<li>Expand the scientific database of gratitude, particularly in the key areas of human health, personal and relational well-being, and developmental science;</li>
	<li>Promote evidence-based practices of gratitude in medical, educational, and organizational settings and in schools, workplaces, homes and communities, and in so doing…</li>
	<li>Engage the public in a larger cultural conversation about the role of gratitude in civil society.</li>
</ul>
So, are you grateful knowing all this about the promise and power and gratitude? If so, try practicing yourself and send someone a <a href="http://elementofgratitude.org/create" target="_blank">Gratitude Gram</a>. “The Gratitude Gram is a fun and easy way to activate gratitude,” says Clio Mallin, communications specialist for the Templeton Foundation. “Challenge yourself, friends, and family to do that visually and socially by sending gratitude grams and inspire others to join the gratitude movement.” Mailin adds that messages can also be posted on the site’s Gratitude Wall to showcase all the gratitude being shared.

Go ahead and do it. You may be the trigger that makes this effort go spiral.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Storytelling that Goes Beyond “What Happened” to “What’s Possible”</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Few things grab our attention more than news about disasters—hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and even mass shootings.  The more tragic the event, the greater the interest and the volume of news coverage.

But as time passes—no matter how gripping or galvanizing the tragedy—our attention (and the news media’s) eventually wanes. With the exception of news and feature stories pegged to anniversaries of these horrific events, we often hear or see little more about people in the affected communities.

Yet, while the "story" might be over for most of us, i<em>s it really over?</em> Or is there more to learn from watching as people rebuild their lives and communities? Can lessons of hope be gleaned from tragedy? Can stories of spirit and resilience provide some hope and guidance?

One person who thinks so is Mallary Tenore, managing director of images &amp; voices of hope (<a href="http://ivoh.org/">ivoh</a>), a nonprofit dedicated to “strengthening the media’s role as an agent of change and world benefit.” Tenore is championing what she calls "Restorative Narratives," a form of journalism that features stories of "how people and communities are learning to rebuild and recover after experiencing difficult times."

According to Tenore, what primarily sets Restorative Narratives apart from more traditional news and feature coverage that follows disaster and tragedy is that these kinds of stories:

[caption id="attachment_6355" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mallarymug2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6355" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Mallarymug2.jpg" alt="Mallary Tenore" width="150" height="200" /></a> Mallary Tenore[/caption]

--<strong>Capture hard truths</strong>. "These narratives don’t ignore the difficult situation that a person or a community has endured," says Tenore. "They explore the rough emotional terrain of the situation, but instead of focusing on what’s broken, they focus on what’s being rebuilt. They reveal hope and possibilities." Tenore cites the work of photographer <a href="http://youok.ru/index.php/project/beslan-identity/" target="_blank">Oksana Yushko</a>, who has visited the Russian city of Beslan 10 times since a school hostage crisis in 2004 that claimed 331 lives, including 186 students. Other photographers also descend on Beslan for anniversary stories, and typically they take pictures of the school’s ruins and of the surviving children, many who are photographed looking sad and dejected, "Yushko’s photographs reveal a different narrative," says Tenore. Though she captures moments of sadness and grief, she also reveals moments that often go unnoticed in the mainstream media — those of hope and resilience."

<strong>--Highlight a meaningful progression.</strong> "Restorative Narratives show progressions — from heartbreak to hope, tragedy to possibility, suffering to recovery." Tenore adds that it's "important to focus not just on where someone is today, but how they got there.” For example, Katharine Q. Seelye's New York Times article,  last April, "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/14/us/a-year-after-boston-marathon-bombings-injured-brothers-endure.html?_r=0" target="_blank">A Year After the Boston Marathon Bombings, Injured Brothers Endure</a>," profiled how P. J. and Paul Norden -- who each lost a leg in the blast -- had been "slowly, achingly," rebuilding their lives.  Describing how the bombing had changed Paul, Seelye writes, "before the marathon, he was complacent about life and didn’t see much purpose in it. 'I didn’t care,' he said. Now, he sets goals — getting out of the wheelchair, losing the crutches, walking the dogs. 'Me and my brother, we’re happy and motivated to do things every day because we’re obviously lucky to be alive,' he said."

<strong>--Are sustained inquiries. </strong>"Restorative Narratives," says Tenore, "are mindful of the fact that recovery is a process that takes time. These narratives may not come to fruition until months or years after a tragedy or period of disruption. Pursuing these narratives requires patience." As an example, she cites <a href="http://res.dallasnews.com/interactives/2013_October/lauren/#.Up_JmmRDuf8" target="_blank">a</a><a href="http://res.dallasnews.com/interactives/2013_October/lauren/#.Up_JmmRDuf8">n eight-part Dallas Morning News</a> series that ran earlier this year about Lauren Kavanaugh — a 20-year-old woman whose mother and stepfather tortured, sexually abused, and starved her for six years when she was a child. Tenore notes that it took reporter reporter Scott Farwell nine months before Kavanaugh was willing to talk with him about her recovery over the years since her 2001 rescue.

--<strong>Are authentic.</strong> "Restorative Narratives are true to a person’s or a community’s experiences," notes Tenore. "Sustained inquires into a person’s life or a community enable us to determine the authenticity of the narrative. Tenore points <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/after-newtown-shooting-mourning-parents-enter-into-the-lonely-quiet/2013/06/08/0235a882-cd32-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_story.html" target="_blank">to a story by the Washington Post's Eli Saslow</a> about how parents coped after losing their children in the Newtown shootings six months earlier. <a href="http://www.journalismcenter.org/article/lonely-quiet-lives-heartbroken-families">Talking later about his reporting</a> for the Post story, Saslow said:  “You feel naturally in some ways in debt to them, but the truth is, the best way to pay that debt is by writing the most honest, complete, best story that you can—a story that will due justice to what they’re going through.”

<strong>--Are strength-based.</strong> "Restorative Narratives speak to people’s strengths and help others find strength," says Tenore. "Instead of focusing on the most dismal aspects of a situation, these narratives get people to care and listen by highlighting what’s possible." After Scott Farewell's <a href="http://res.dallasnews.com/interactives/2013_October/lauren/#.Up_JmmRDuf8" target="_blank">eight-part series</a> on kidnap survivor Lauren Kavanaugh appeared in the Dallas Morning News, readers donated $14,000 to help her deal with her financial struggles. Says Tenore, "Scott's story made people care enough to want to help others."

Tenore also argues that Restorative Narratives can do what straight news reporting can't. “Restorative Narratives can compel people to become more engaged in their community and act in ways that benefit society. This type of engagement is especially important in the aftermath of tragedy."  That story of coping after tragedy is at the core of Eli Saslow's Washington Post article about the parents who lost children in the Newtown shooting.

Another benefit of this form of storytelling is how it can help alleviate some of the stress shown to result from a preponderance of negative news coverage. Tenore points to <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/07/10/323355132/binging-on-bad-news-can-fuel-daily-stress?utm_source=npr_newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=20140710&amp;utm_campaign=dailydigest&amp;utm_term=nprnews" target="_blank">a study</a> conducted by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard School of Public Health, which found that one in four people say they experienced a “great deal” of stress over the past month. Consuming news, they said, was one of the biggest contributors to their day-to-day stress.

"When people are overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed, they often feel paralyzed. News coverage of disruption and breakdown, then, may actually interfere with a community’s or a person’s ability to respond to crisis in creative and effective ways. By shifting the traditional journalistic focus from devastation and despair to resilience and recovery, we can create a world where people are mobilized by the news, rather than paralyzed by it – a world where people are brought together by the power of narrative."

ivoh is already taking steps to build support for the Restorative Narrative genre. Last month, it launched a new Restorative Narrative Fellowship and selected the first five fellows. The fellowships run for six months and each of the five selected journalists will receive a stipend to help them tell Restorative Narratives in various communities.
<ul>
	<li>Ben Montgomery, Tampa Bay Times reporter and Pulitzer finalist</li>
	<li>Rochelle Riley, Detroit Free Press columnist</li>
	<li>Alex Tizon, Pulitzer prize-winning journalist, author, and University of Oregon journalism professor</li>
	<li>Jake Harper, freelance public radio journalist in Washington, D.C.</li>
	<li>Elissa Yancey, journalist &amp; University of Cincinnati journalism professor</li>
</ul>
According to Tenore, stories the fellows produce will be published on their news organizations’ websites and on <a href="http://ivoh.org/" target="_blank">ivoh.org</a>. "With this fellowship, we want to deepen our understanding of the Restorative Narrative genre so that we can help journalists and others in media learn how to develop stories that bring strength and resilience to the communities they cover. We also hope to develop some curriculum and training around this genre."

ivoh also recently launched an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ivoh-s-restorative-narrative-fellows#home" target="_blank">Indiegogo campaign</a> to raise money for the fellowship program, with the hope that Restorative Narratives can be integrated into newsrooms in the U.S. and abroad.

Tenore feels the time is right for Restorative Narratives. As she puts it, "People’s appetite for news is changing, and with that change comes opportunity — to tell stories that shift the traditional journalistic focus from tragedy to recovery."]]></content:encoded>

If you press her, she can even tell you to the second when our 2015 upcoming frank gathering gets underway. That's because <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/" target="_blank">we have a clock</a> on our website furiously counting down the days, hours, minutes and yes, seconds, until the February 25th kickoff.

Of course, we're not unique when it comes to countdowns. It's a very common way to herald the coming of something big.  Despite its ubiquity, however, the word is relatively new. It was first introduced into the English language in the early 1950s as a term to describe the procedure NASA used to tick off the minutes and seconds before a rocket launch.

See how it's taken off ever since.

But what if it countdown meant something else? Instead of the number days until something begins, what if represented how may years, weeks and days we have left before time runs out? Imagine if we were counting down the remaining days to adequately fix some of the many pressing social issues we face in the world? Like climate change? Poverty? Hunger? The list goes on.

That's an idea put forward a few years ago by Grant Oliphant in a Tedx Pittsburgh talk. Oliphant, who at the time headed the Pittsburgh Foundation and now serves as president of The Heinz Endowments, argues in his talk (<strong>see video below</strong>) that people in the business of building a better world would be better served keeping track of how long you have before the clock runs out and you run out of time.. As he wryly suggests, <em>imagine a countdown clock without a reset button.</em>

Oliphant's message should resonate loudly for communicators. If part of our job is to amplify the messages of the organizations we serve, we don't have a minute or second to waste. We must use every precious moment of time to ensure our messages are thoughtful, on target and we constantly measure how they're working -- and while there's still time.

		<title>Why Traditional Media Still Matters</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/01/why-traditional-media-still-matters/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A version of this post appears in <a href="http://www.ripplestrategies.com/use-media-social-change-report/" target="_blank">How to Use the Media for Social Change</a>, a report published by <a href="http://www.ripplestrategies.com/" target="_blank">Ripple Strategies</a>.</em>

It is no surprise that newspapers are struggling, given the unlimited amount of free content available online. For years newspapers have been trying to develop an effective pay model for accessing digital content. But, for the most part, these attempts have failed. According to the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism’s <a href="http://www.digitalnewsreport.org/survey/2013/paying-for-news-2013/">2013 Digital News Report</a>, “only 12 percent of American consumers have paid for digital news content in the past year and . . . only 9 percent of those who haven’t paid for digital news in the past can see themselves doing so at some point in the future.”

The reduction of revenue and unique viewership throughout the industry has led to a marked shrinking of reporting power in traditional media outlets. If they haven’t closed up shop entirely, they are likely short on staff to conduct investigations, or unable to unearth and research stories before they explode on Twitter. Many overworked and underpaid reporters and newsroom staffers have quit--or been laid off--under the demanding pressures.

It doesn’t help that anybody with a mobile device can instantly upload original content to the Internet--and at times, report an ongoing situation more rapidly and accurately than a professional journalist. With such fundamental shifts in the industry--including recent announcements of major layoffs at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/layoffs-new-york-times.html?_r=1" target="_blank">The New York Times</a> and <a href="http://jimromenesko.com/2014/09/03/gannett-layoff-updates-are-trickling-in/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>--many are wondering if the death knell has sounded for traditional media.

We don’t think so. Social media has a ways to go before it becomes people’s primary source of news. First of all, it has credibility issues. During the Boston marathon bombings, for example, so-called citizen-journalists sat with their radios tuned to police scanners and then collectively--via the “front page of the Internet” website <a href="http://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>--claimed to have identified the bomber as missing Brown University student Sunil Tripathi. Tripathi’s family woke to floods of journalists arriving on their front steps, demanding answers. A few crazed hours later, when the real bombers were identified as the Tsarnaev brothers, the true nature of the social web was revealed. That is, that the Internet can create mass unfounded hysteria, just as the radio did when Orson Welles read War of the Worlds in 1938, leading people to believe that Martians were invading.
<blockquote>Social media has a ways to go before it becomes people’s primary source of news.</blockquote>
Second, although the Internet is often idealized as the “voice of the people,” free from corruption and without an agenda, that is hardly the case with social media platforms, which are fundamentally in the business of selling data and ads. Their job is to get people to spend as much time as possible on their platforms, so that they can collect as much information about individual users as possible, which they then provide to advertisers. They play an active role in coaxing content from every Tom, Dick, and Siri they can, resulting in a massive movement of citizen journalism, whereby everyday people are collecting, reporting, analyzing, and disseminating information. “Influencers” are then offered generous incentives to tweet or write about certain products or ideas. Analytics on search histories and Internet activities can be used to target content to readers that they are likely to believe is authoritative, when it often is not.

Finally, when we examine the data surrounding trends in media consumption, it is clear that despite the fact that people spend ample time on social media, when it comes to searching for reliable information, Facebook and Twitter are often just gateways to the New York Times or Wall Street Journal websites. Indeed, the Pew Research Center’s <a href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2013/overview-5/" target="_blank">2013 State of the Media report</a> shows the use of social networking sites is not mutually exclusive with the use of traditional media sites. In fact, in many cases, social media encourages people to seek out <em>more</em> traditional media. Traditional outlets are still viewed as sources of authoritative content, while social media acts as an aggregator--a series of impressions and opinions--rather than a collection of reliable facts.

People crave authority; they want to know where to look when issues are unclear, and information is either too sparse or too abundant. And like it or not, traditional media outlets capitalize on this innate human desire, signaling to viewers that something is credible, well-researched, or factual by attaching familiar faces and names to the stories they produce.

The central role of traditional media is often overlooked by the many groups who are clamoring to capitalize on the social media craze. Thinking of it as a “free” way to get the word out, organizations on a budget often look to social media as a foundation for their communications strategy. But social media is far from free; done properly, an online communications campaign requires valuable time--and often a significant amount of money as well. While many digital tools are free, the time, technology, and expertise needed to gather a following and keep the momentum going, is anything but. And, depending on the exact nature of the campaign, it can be incredibly helpful to integrate a social media strategy with traditional PR, to generate the kind of high profile, respected media coverage that an organization deserves.
<blockquote>Traditional media signal that something is credible, well-researched, or factual by attaching familiar faces and names to the stories they produce.</blockquote>
In short, social and traditional media are inextricably dependent on one another for success. In order to create buzz--which is what sustains social media platforms--there must be something to create a buzz about. And as long as the demand for original and authoritative content exists, traditional outlets will remain in business to satisfy it. And the greatest power of all comes from recognizing and facilitating how each type of media amplifies each other.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What We’re Learning From What Others Are Discovering</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/01/what-were-learning-from-what-others-are-discovering/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[At frank, we put a premium on finding and sharing research that can lead to better social change communications practice.

This work is much on our mind as we get ready for our second frank gathering in February, when we will again award prizes to those doing academic research that informs and helps advance communications aimed at building a better world. So this seems like it would be a good time to look back at what we’ve learned, both from our awards program and from the many articles we’ve been publishing on <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/" target="_blank">frankology</a></span> and our blog since we launched in August.

Here are three things we can’t ignore:

<strong>1. People act according to how they see themselves, their values and their place in the world</strong>

It isn’t news that people’s receptivity to messages – especially those trying to get them to act or think differently -- are influenced by their values, self-perception and core beliefs. It helps explain why sometimes we’re eager to accept what we hear or at other times reject it. For communicators, the most useful research are studies that shed light on why people look the other way even when presented with evidence that suggests getting vaccinated, cutting down on energy use or eating healthier is in their best interest. And, thankfully, we have a lot we can share on that topic.

For example, Dan Kahan, the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of Law &amp; Professor of Psychology at Yale Law School, looked at what causes people to deny scientific evidence in public debates about global warming and vaccinating young girls against cancer. Kahan says the denial results from “a dynamic known as ‘cultural cognition,’ or “the tendency of individuals to conform their beliefs about disputed matters of fact (e.g. whether global warming is a serious threat, whether the death penalty deters murder or whether gun control makes society more safe or less) to values that define their cultural identities,” regardless of what science might say.

In an article in the October 2013 issue of Science, (<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014/11/have-you-heard-we-have-a-science-communication-problem/" target="_blank">summarized here</a>), he suggests one solution to this denial problem might be “evidence-informed risk communication strategies,” or strategies that frame the science as a rational choice. By framing science-based issues, like climate change or human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccinations this way, Kahan says, "perhaps we can get people to see that their cultural identities are not threatened, but that the suggested solution or recommendation is the wisest course of action."

Similarly, in a study submitted to our 2015 prize in public interest communications, Dartmouth College political science professor Brendan Nyhan found that when it comes to polarizing issues – such as the cause for insurgent attacks in Iraq, factors affecting job growth in the US and global temperature change – people are unwilling to acknowledge factual information if it conflicts with their existing beliefs. Nyhan writes, “People resist acknowledging unwelcome facts because those facts are threatening to their worldview or self-concept. . . when people feel forced to choose between who they are and what others want them to believe, the facts will too often lose out.”

Research suggests that if we want to effect  long-lasting change in the public interest, we have to start by acknowledging how people see their world and their place in it. We also must communicate in their language. Our messages can’t threaten or challenge their identities, it must help them see the benefits for themselves and their larger community.

<b>2. The messenger is key</b>

<em>Who</em> delivers the message is just as important as <em>how</em> the message is delivered. Studies conducted across disciplines and in a range of settings suggest that local social networks are an effective means to change people’s behaviors and attitudes.

For example, in their 2015 frank prize submission, marketing and advertising psychologists David Sleeth-Keppler, Humboldt State University, and Robert Perkowitz and Meighen Speiser, ecoAmerica, found that one way to engage those who resist or are indifferent to climate change information is through their own social networks, such as family, neighbors, religious congregations, co-workers, local community officials and health care providers. These social networks slowly drop seeds that will help foster engagement in climate change.

“Different audiences in America vary reliably in their degree of concern about climate change,” the researchers write. “An important question for practical future climate change outreach is how to effectively reach audiences that dismiss the issue, or are otherwise skeptical or unwilling to act… One approach to increase engagement among resisting or indifferent audiences would be to connect with people on climate change where they live, using informal communicators.”

Similarly, University of Florida sociologist and public health scholar Lauren Gilbert suggests in her frank 2015 prize entry that when it comes to reaching the most vulnerable populations, local messengers are key. Gilbert studied the effectiveness of using African-American survivors of prostate cancer to advocate for increased awareness about the disease and the benefits of screening education to other African-Americans. She found that local messengers who have experienced cancer could be the most effective at reaching African-American men and increasing their knowledge and action regarding prostate cancer. Gilbert writes, “Survivor advocates can provide a trusted and ongoing voice within the community … because they are familiar faces sharing their own experiences and bringing the messages of awareness and prevention, which they often are able to ‘translate’ into terms that men can easily understand.”

Furthermore, new research suggests that a conversation with a messenger who has “lived” the issue can create long-lasting changes in attitudes around polarizing issues. For example, political scientists Michael Lacour and Donal Green <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/want-to-change-minds-start-by-having-a-face-to-face-conversation/" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">found that having a conversation with a gay canvasser</span></a> dramatically altered attitudes toward same-sex marriage. “Gay and straight canvassers produced distinctive patterns of attitude change… but only gay canvassers’ effects persisted in 3-week, 6-week, and 9-month follow-ups,” LaCour and Green write. “Our experimental results demonstrate that active contact is capable of producing a cascade of enduring opinion change.”
<p class="BodyA"><strong>3.</strong> <b>Effective communications are often a shade of grey</b></p>
<strong>T</strong>here is no one, fixed way to effectively share our messages. Instead, we have to keep in mind that strategies should be situation based. In their exploration of the growing reliance on Twitter among advocacy groups, researchers Chao Guo at the University of Pennsylvania and Gregory Saxton at the University of Buffalo <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-pyramid-approach-how-twitter-use-is-shaping-up-among-advocacy-groups/" target="_blank">uncovered what they called a layered, “pyramid-style”</a> approach to how advocacy groups use social media as part of their outreach efforts. They found that how an advocacy organization uses Twitter is based on its campaign stage, outreach goals and intended audiences. “At stage one, the organization’s priority is to reach out and bring awareness of the cause to the public,” the authors say. “The messages sent by the organization are predominantly informational and serve to support the public education tactic. At stage two, the organization’s priority switches to sustaining communities of interest and networks of supporters. The messages, in turn, focus more on community building and direct interactive conversations between organizations and their publics. At stage three, the organization’s priority becomes mobilization, which the organization achieves through a smaller number of targeted ‘call to action’ messages.”

Context is fundamental in communications. Starting with where people are and their cultural norms can provide insight as to what to include in a campaign. For example, marketing researcher Iman Naderi at Fairfield University and David Sutton at the University of North Texas f<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-to-make-narcissists-think-green-is-the-new-black/" target="_blank">ound that playing into people’s narcissistic tendencies</a> (a growing trend in the U.S.) can be an effective way to shift purchasing behavior toward more “green” or earth-friendly habits. They found that narcissists were more likely to purchase green products if others around them could see them in a public setting purchasing or using the product. They were also more likely to buy green products if doing so provided some sort of higher class status and if their peers highly valued green products. Naderi and Strutton suggest that, “As a direct consequence of normal narcissists’ propensity to engage, as expected, in highly self-absorbed consumption behavior environmental communicators need to create strategies that play to those traits.” In other words, we have to start with where people are, and our strategies must be open and contextual.

That's a brief look at what we've learned so far through our efforts to find, synthesize and share useful communications research. Rest assured, there's lots more to come.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>The King Of Social Change Communicators</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, we honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. for his legendary work as a leader, activist and humanitarian.

King, however, should also be remembered as one of the most effective public interest communicators of our time. Richard Lischer, author of “The Preacher King: Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Word that Moved America,” writes, “[King] practiced the creativity of a preacher and a poet. He had the preacher’s (and actor’s and politician’s) knack of translating every stray piece of information into the dramatic communication of ideas. Although he was a shrewd social strategist, his genius was poetic in nature, for he had the prophet’s eye for seeing local injustices in light of transcendent truths.”

King’s success can be seen in his ability to create and deliver messages and organize people to address society’s injustices. Many of his strategies are used today by social change communicators.

One prominent example is the Montgomery, Ala., bus boycotts in 1965 through 1966, which brought King to national attention for the first time. The idea for the boycotts came from Jo Ann Robinson, a leader in Montgomery’s Women’s Political Council. The idea came to her in 1950, and in 1954, she wrote the mayor and hinted that if bus drivers didn’t start to treat black riders differently, black riders would respond with a boycott.

The night Rosa Parks was arrested, Robinson mimeographed more than 50,000 copies of a flier urging blacks riders to stay off the bus. The one-day boycott was so effective that the community voted to extend the boycott and elected the 26-year-old King as their leader.

As the boycott went on, the nonviolent protests paved the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1956 declaring segregation of public buses unconstitutional.

King and the other organizers relied on a strategy key to any successful public interest communication effort: highlighting something morally wrong and then creating a compelling call to action that forces others to take notice. From a tactical perspective, King and his fellow organizers were also wise to use the boycotting technique because of the economic pain it caused the bus company and other businesses in the city. And in an era in which Americans were turning to television for theirs news, the footage of thousands of people walking to work created great visuals that worked well for television.

As an orator, King also left his mark. Few speeches delivered before or since have the extraordinary resonance of his speech on the National Mall on Aug. 28, 1963.

His words that day still soar:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <em>I say to you today, my friends. And so, even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> </em><em>I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: </em><em>‘</em><em>We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.</em><em>’</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em> </em><em>I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>I have a dream today!</em></p>
King didn’t have a screen or a powerpoint presentation, but his visual language spoke to American values and history. Science now tells us that our brains retain messages that invoke images and stories that speak to our values and culture.

Over time, King used his understanding of how to gain media coverage to help sway public opinion. Probably the best-recorded examples (and the subjects of an academy award-nominated film) were three marches organized in Selma, Ala., to address voter repression in the South.

The marches from Selma to the state capital in Montgomery took place in March of 1965. Although the first two marches were stopped before reaching Montgomery, the television coverage of Alabama state troopers brutally beating the marchers galvanized the public.

Finally, on March 21, 1965, King and other civil rights leaders led 2,000 people on their third, successful march to Montgomery. This time, the Alabama National Guard, under orders from President Lyndon B. Johnson, protected the protesters.

Over the course of the three marches, black voter disenfranchisement in the South became a topic of national conversation and led to the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which guaranteed the right to vote for all black Americans, because King was able to connect an abstract topic—disenfranchised black voters—with powerful visuals.

“King was a master manipulator of media,” says civil rights expert Travis Atria, “He was very careful about which causes he put his weight behind, because he knew that Selma wasn't just Selma… These were chances to communicate the evils of racism and segregation to the entire world. There's a famous story during the march on Selma where a Life Magazine photographer put down his camera to help a marcher who was being beaten by police. King saw it, took the cameraman aside and told him, ‘Your role is to photograph what is happening to us.’ He knew that a picture in Life Magazine of a black man being beaten by the cops during a peaceful march would do more to help black people than trying to stop the cop in that particular instance. He wasn't interested in posturing; he was only interested in results.”

King’s effectiveness as a communicator, and that of those with whom he surrounded himself, propelled the civil rights movement forward, and is a potent reminder that even the most seemingly insurmountable problems can be overcome.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>We All Have A Stake In This Conversation</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last year, for an intense 10 minutes, I found myself once again immersed in the dungeonous Land of the Stakeholder. I was editing a document that, within a single page noted that “invitees would include national stakeholders as well as stakeholders representing communities.” A few lines later, there was a “focus on local media outreach and engagement with stakeholders, “ followed by my favorite: “engaging stakeholders, elected officials, business leaders, stakeholders, media and residents.”

The stakeholders are everywhere! But, precisely who are they, and why are these nameless people cluttering up so much of the audience in social change communications? Are they carnivores who prefer flank to strip stakes, filet mignon to beef stew? Are they horse racing aficionados who are invested in the outcome at Belmont each year? Or, truth be told, are we getting lazy, taking short-cuts in our strategic targeting of audiences with a catch-all word that, in the end, means nothing?

Let’s hold ourselves to a challenging standard of articulating who the stakeholders really are.  If we’re talking about advocates, we should say so. Are they the policy influ<img class="alignright  wp-image-7121" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-25-07.32.00.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-25 07.32.00" width="279" height="298" />encers who stand to advance the agendas of specific target audiences, if certain actions are taken? Or, put another way, are they the “interest groups” of old, like the teachers unions, medical associations, or Chamber of Commerce?

In a different vein, are they the constituents themselves -- the homeless people, obese people and school children who certainly have a stake in policy reforms? Are they prisoners who stand to be released from incarceration if policy reform is implemented? Are they community college students, the object of education debates?

Those of us seeking to advocate successfully for poverty reduction and improved opportunities in health, education, sustainability, gender equality and a host of other desirables have taken as biblical that successful advocacy is rarely about reaching “the general public.” In fact, when counseling nonprofit leaders, we make clear very early on that the audience must be defined, and that it’s virtually never “the general public.”

We have dodged the hard work of accountability in documenting actual, quantifiable change by substituting “stakeholder” for “the general public” and a whole host of others involved in creating social change. If we’re honest, much as the general public has an interest in just and fair social policy, we’re all stakeholders, because we all have a stake in good outcomes that bend toward social justice.
<blockquote>Let’s hold ourselves to a challenging standard of articulating who the stakeholders really are.</blockquote>
So, we could all loosely claim a stake in affordable housing, but if we’re rigorous, the true stakeholders are those who can’t afford a decent place to live. And, we’re all stakeholders in plans to encourage healthier eating, but those most at risk of obesity, malnutrition or food-borne illness are the ones with a real stake in policies – less so than athletes with 8 per cent body mass index who down vegetable shakes for breakfast each morning.  Sure, affordable housing and healthy eating are good for all of us in society, because they promote healthier communities and reduce public expenditures in one way or another. But, let’s be honest about who’s got a real stake in the game: it’s those of us who are suffering in one way or another.

If we want to be precise about the word “stakeholder,” we might want to stick to universal wants that truly affect us all equally and about which we are all vulnerable – a sustainable environment and world peace, for two. But, we communicators can certainly do better than falling back on “stakeholder” when speaking of big, cosmic, existential needs that are the definers of a functioning civilization.

Let’s name names, and measure our success as communicators by our ability to drive policy deciders in public and private life to achieve specific goals for specific groups of people – the people with the most at stake, the people for whom we really work.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>When Journalists Offer Solutions, Problems Get Fixed</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/01/when-journalists-offer-solutions-problems-get-fixed/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2015 13:59:55 +0000</pubDate>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We rely on the news media to diligently report on problems that society needs to fix—from failing schools, to income inequality, to hunger, to gun violence—just to name a few. Recently, though, some journalists have been moving beyond just highlighting problems we need to solve to actually pointing out solutions.

Proponents and practitioners of what's known as "solutions journalism" describe it as providing "rigorous, compelling coverage of responses to social problems—reporting done with the highest of journalistic standards.” Underlying the push for this kind of reporting is a concern that if the news media fails to highlight how people and institutions are working to solve problems, then we’re not getting the whole story.

Among those giving solutions journalism a big push is the <a href="http://solutionsjournalism.org/" target="_blank">Solutions Journalism Network</a> (SJN), a nonprofit founded by David Bornstein and Tina Rosenberg, veteran reporters who write the “<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/fixes/" target="_blank">Fixes</a>” column at The New York Times, and Courtney E. Martin, a journalist and author. <a href="#bornvid">In a talk delivered</a> at the 2014 frank gathering in Gainesville last February, Bornstein described solutions journalism as a kind of how-to narrative. Solutions journalism stories show readers "how to make sure kids with asthma don't end up in the emergency room once a week" to "how to prevent kids from toxic stress" to "how to solve crime."

<img class="alignright  wp-image-7183" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Screenshot-2015-01-26-18.56.53.png" alt="Screenshot 2015-01-26 18.56.53" width="307" height="309" />SJN has just published the "<a href="http://bit.ly/1Bkv6pj" target="_blank">Solutions Journalism Toolkit,</a>" which authors Martin and Sarika Bansal say walks “users through the practice of solutions journalism, from the first step — identifying a response worth investigating—to the last—engaging readers in your piece once it is published.”

One of the arguments the toolkit advances for an increased emphasis on solutions journalism over traditional reporting is that the current “theory of change” that “pointing out social problems will spur reform” doesn’t live up to the promise.  The authors write, “It is increasingly inadequate for journalists to simply note what’s wrong and hope for society to create better laws or provide proper oversight. The world’s problems are just too complex and fast-changing. People must learn about credible examples of responses to problems in order to become empowered, discerning actors capable of shaping a better society. In this context, journalism must augment its traditional role, spotlighting adaptive responses to entrenched social ills.”
<blockquote>If the news media fails to highlight how people and institutions are working to solve problems, then we’re not getting the whole story.</blockquote>
The examples the toolkit offers are one of the best ways to understand what makes solutions journalism unique. Among them:

—A year-long series in the Corpus ChristI Caller-Times called “<a href="http://www.caller.com/cost-of-diabetes" target="_blank">Cost of Diabetes”</a> that did more than just bring attention to the fact that Corpus Christi, Texas has the highest rate of amputations in America. Instead, the series described how other U.S. communities were doing better at dealing with diabetes care. According to the author, Rhiannon Meyers, the series helped spark conversations “here about what we can do differently and what we are not doing now.”

—After reading a New York Times “<a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/making-change-happen-on-a-deadline/" target="_blank">Fixes</a>” column about a community mobilizing strategy called Rapid Results, organizers of the 100,000 Homes campaign got in touch with Rapid Results and learned how to implement it in communities where the group was trying to find housing for homeless people. Through its work with Rapid Results, the campaign met its goal of housing 100,000 chronically homeless people.

—As a result of three solutions-focused stories in a <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/chronic-crisis-a-system-that-doesnt-heal-milwaukee-county-mental-health-system-210480011.html#!/emergency-detentions/" target="_blank">Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel series</a> on poor treatment options for mental health partients, a new health board was established in Milwaukee to oversee the former system and the city increased its budget for mental health care.

Along with those examples of effective solutions journalism as as guidance and writing tips, one of the most valuable elements of the report, is the discussionabout what’s not considered solutions journalism. Among the “no nos":

—<b>Hero worship</b> stories that “gush about the person’s decision to leave a high-paying job to save the world.”

—<b>Silver bullet</b> pieces that “describe new gadgets in glowing terms, often referring to them as ‘lifesavers.’”

—<b>Think tank </b>articles that propose “things that don’t yet exist.”

—<b>Chris P. Bacon</b> riffs about “good people doing cute things,” but that leave out “the structural issues that we want solutions journalism to address.

Done well — and correctly — solutions journalism has much to offer.  As toolkit authors Bansal and Martin write, “Many of us became journalists because we want to have an impact, to make the world better. But uncovering wrongdoing isn’t the only way to have an impact. Revealing problems is crucial, of course — but that impact is magnified if alongside the problems, we report on how people are trying to solve them."

		<title>Grab A Cup Of Coffee And Watch A Great Talk</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2014/" target="_blank">At last year's frank gathering</a> in Gainesville, thinkers, writers and communications practitioners spoke on a range of topics that illuminated the ways people receive and process information and how communicators can harness that knowledge to develop compelling messages, campaigns and other kinds of outreach designed to address pressing social problems and needs.

As we prepare for <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/" target="_blank">this year's gathering</a>, we're nostalgically watching our favorite talks from last year. If you missed frank 2014, you'll enjoy these highlights. If you were there, enjoy watching them again. With this post, we're kicking off a special series featuring some of the frank gathering presentations, that a year later, <i>frankly speaking</i>, people are still talking about.

For starters, we present a revealing talk by <strong><a href="#shankvid">Shankar Vedantam</a></strong>, NPR's social science correspondent, about accountability and how it's often misunderstood and misapplied. Vedantam, who will be speaking later this month at our 2015 frank gathering, argues that accountability should be used as a means to "make good things happen in the future," but too often, it's used to hold people "account" for things that happened in the past, and sometimes as a punishment.

As an example, he cites how President George W. Bush sold the Iraq war to the nation to "hold the perpetrators of 9/11 to account." He contrasts the money spent on a failed war -- in response to the deaths of 3,000 people -- to the miniscule funds allocated to address suicide, which claims some 300,000 lives annually in the United States--100 times the number who died on 9/11. "On a rational basis, it doesn't make sense," says Vedantam.

Vendatam cites the choice to spend considerable more money to fight terrorism over suicide prevention as an example of "cognitive bias," which results in human beings sometimes focusing irrationally on what we perceive a threat greater than it really is. When these "biases are amplified over millions of people at the level of policy," the result, says Vendatam, are decisions that don't always serve the public interest.

Over the course of his talk, Vendatam makes the case for what he calls "Accountability 2.0," a new approach that -- instead of trying to motivate people with by warning of consequences if they fail -- capitalizes on the drive that encourages people "to be the best they can be."

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A version of this post orginally appeared on <a href="http://philanthropynewsdigest.org/columns/cause-driven-design/how-nonprofits-design-firms-collaborate-to-change-the-world" target="_blank">Philanthropy News Digest.</a></em>

As a designer who works almost exclusively with mission-focused nonprofits, I frequently get asked, "What is cause-driven design?" My response is usually another question: "What is design?"

The definition I've adopted, brought to my attention by branding expert <a href="http://archive.neutronllc.com/Pages/Interview.html" target="_blank">Marty Neumeier</a>, comes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon" target="_blank">Herbert Simon</a>, a Nobel-Prize winning political scientist, economist, and sociologist:

<strong><em>Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.</em></strong>

So, when we think of design, we must first recognize that pretty much everyone – and not just "creative people"— designs in one way or another. Nonprofit organizations, committed to creating positive change in the world, are continuously engaged in the act of design.

Second, when we "design," we're not necessarily creating actual things (like websites or annual reports). Moreover, whatever it is we are creating, it almost always involves a complex, interdisciplinary system of ideas, actions, and messaging that, with a lot of hard work and a little luck, will alter a situation from what it is to what we'd like it to be.

Organizational planning? Design. Copywriting? Design. Software development? Design. That workaround you used to fix your leaky faucet until the plumber showed up? You get the point.

Design, as every good designer knows, is nothing without context. And context, to be meaningful, requires us to look at things from a whole bunch of perspectives, then thinking them through before we sit down to "design" that report cover, tagline, data visualization, or website. To borrow an analogy from the medical field, we've got to diagnose the situation before we can prescribe a course of treatment.

<em>So what is cause-driven design?</em> As its name implies, it is a process whose central organizing principle has to do with more effectively engaging and educating audiences on and about issues, connecting them to causes they care about, and delivering more meaningful brand experiences that help advance a mission and lead to greater impact (however an organization defines "impact"). Whether the nonprofit in question operates on the front lines of an urgent social issue or works more quietly behind the scenes, it is about understanding the context in which the really important questions are formulated, then aligning every messaging effort to explain why the answers to the questions are important.

At its best, cause-driven design cuts through the clutter of our busy lives, calms our over-stimulated brains, and helps to organize the plethora of choices we all face, every day. It unites strategy, content, design, and technology in ways that enables your nonprofit to more effectively engage with its principal audiences and speak more meaningfully to their deeper needs, goals, and motivations. It's bigger than the brand, it's bigger than design; it's the mission or cause we're driven to take up.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[“Measles on Amtrak.” “Measles in New York Public Schools.” These are today’s headlines that are brought to you by the success of Jenny McCarthy steering millions down the wrong path. McCarthy is listed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_McCarthy" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> as an American model, television host, comedic actress, author and anti-vaccine activist.

What may be less known or understood is that this public health crisis is also brought to you by the failure of many scientists, and their communications specialists, to publicly voice scientific truths.

For the past several years NBC’s on-air medical expert Nancy Snyderman, M.D., has been one of the only spokespeople representing so many scientists who couldn’t or wouldn’t speak out about the enormous body of evidence indicating that there is no causal link between young children’s vaccine regimen and autism. <a href="http://www.vox.com/2015/2/2/7965885/the-research-linking-autism-to-vaccines-is-even-more-terrible-than" target="_blank">This Vox article</a>, <strong>“</strong>The research linking autism to vaccines is even more bogus than you think” tells the backstory on the science, and the false science that gave rise to the invalid McCarthy campaign.

Why didn’t scientists speak up? Why didn’t their communicators guide and sometimes push them to do the right thing? Perhaps because of a hugely successful campaign led by McCarthy developing at the same time.

Jenny McCarthy’s son showed signs of autism around the same time that he received his vaccinations from the pediatrician. McCarthy did the right thing first. She perceptively saw early signs in her son, and immediately followed up with physicians who treated her son with the latest of autism therapies.   However, despite the evidence, she firmly believed that the vaccines caused her son’s autism.

I don’t know what happened next, whether she talked with doctors or consulted psychics, but what she didn’t do is read the medical literature to find there is no connection between vaccinations and autism.   And if she did, she chose not to believe it.

Firm in her own belief, she began her campaign against vaccinations, rallying mommy bloggers, speaking out at events, on television, radio and in print.   Before you knew it, she had millions on her side. Unfortunately, it wasn’t the safe side for many suffering from measles today.

In a <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21134540/vp/27453507#27453507" target="_blank">Today Show interview</a> as far back as 2008, Dr. Snyderman foreshadows the future, “If parents don’t get their children vaccinated, there are going to be outbreaks of polio and measles in this country.” Predictive words.

What were communicators doing to prepare scientists to tell the important truths about McCarthy’s inaccurate information?   What would have happened in this scenario if the researchers who did all these studies had spoken up with jargon-free clear language and early in the process? What if they weren’t fearful to be badgered by the public or to feel nervous about what their peers might think?   What if they used the social media to educate the public about the truth, or speak on national television and in print?

The “Jenny McCarthy factor” can only be stopped by scientists willing to speak up and advocate. With such definitive science in this case, there is no excuse that measles are back because millions of families are shying away from baby vaccines.

As communicators, in the speed of releasing a report or new data to meet an embargoed release date, we often forget the importance of supporting the spokesperson with strategic communications guidance, messaging, and preparation. We would be wise to step out of our own comfort zone and push back when the researcher feels timid to speak to the media or the public and ask the researcher, “If not you, then who?”   In many ways, we are the conduit to improved science communications and it is our job to make research and science clear and to make sure it is heard.

More recently Jenny McCarthy finally accepted the truth. Dr. Snyderman has been known to say to the public, “Get your damn vaccines.”   To scientists I say, find your voice – accurate and clear - and use it.   And to us communicators, let’s keep pushing for the truth to be told.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for this post. I think it would be great if scientists were more visible in the media telling the scientific truth.  

However, I wonder how persuasive McCarthy (or even Mayim Bialik) actually was? See, for example, the blog posts on vaccines by Dan Kahan of the Cultural Cognition project: http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2015/2/9/let-it-be-measuring-partisan-reactions-to-existing-mandatory.html
http://www.culturalcognition.net/blog/2015/2/5/what-does-christie-know-that-the-rest-of-us-dont-my-guess-is.html
His data were through 2013; it will be interesting to see what, if anything, changes (and how) after the recent measles outbreaks. I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Katie - thanks for your comment.  I'm glad to see the point of the blog got through. My only point is that I believe scientists need to speak up.  Unfortunately, in one case related to this autism-vaccine connection, one doctor has supported vaccines regularly in the public sphere at a high risk.  He has received death threats from anti-vaccine people for years.  I am amazed that he keeps up the effort, but if he had dozens of other scientists supporting him we would all be better off.  Politics will always get in the way, but that's a whole other blog!  Thanks.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Too many doctors perpetuate the "Thou shalt not question thy doctor" attitude and treat their patients like idiots.  I say this as an educated women with two kids on the autism spectrum - if you're not a doctor, you are must be a simpleton.  Have you not read the party line?  It's clearly stated on the website.  Any other questions are just proof of your own stupidity and will be ignored.  
I meet a lot of parents of special needs kids, and compassionate doctors who are willing to truly listen to their concerns and give a thoughtful, measured response are extrodinarily rare.  Even parents of autistic kids who are medical doctors complain of this: "You're just imagining things," "You're just paranoid."  I was fortunate enough to find one of these doctors (after several misses) and the difference is amazing.  She was willing (15 years ago) to discuss the current research about vaccines instead of just passing down the offical party line.  She was willing to split up vaccines and stagger them for patients who were concerned.  Most importantly, she related her own experiences of being blown off and always encouraged us to tell her of any concerns we might have, even just a vague feeling that something was off.  So when she told patients that current research didn't support a link between autism and vaccines, they trusted her.  And they trusted her because she treated her patients like people and not idiots.
The anti-vaccine movement is unfortunate, but I don't find it surprising.  I've just known too many doctors who act like they're omnipotent, cutting you off before you even finish speaking, and then lecture you on why you're being stupid.  Is it any surprise so many parent sought answers elsewhere?  Blame celebutantes all you want, but established doctor culture laid the ground work for people looking everywhere else for answers.]]></wp:comment_content>

Twitter may force us to use fewer words to deliver our messages. But ironically, even an organization like <a href="http://www.hrw.org/" target="_blank">Human Rights Watch</a> that deals with ugly and complicated subjects, such as torture and murder, has found that the combination of brevity and focus makes the group's communications more effective.

Caroll Bogert, deputy executive director, external relations, for Human Rights Watch admitted, however, during her frank 2014 talk, that when she first heard about Twitter, she thought of it as the "ultimate insult to the idea of complexity....How can you possible say anything important in 140 characters?"

In the years since, Twitter and other social media tools have helped power Human Rights' communications strategies. Bogert now describes Twitter as a way "to point a finger" to where people can find a lengthier and fuller description of the problems Human RIghts Watch is addressing around the world. She adds that Twiter aslo "has turned out to be the place where journalists go for information."

Video, too, has become a mainstay of the work of Human Rights Watch, as the ability to collect stories of abuses told by the victims themselves, also fuels the group's ability to capture public and media attention about problems that need action..

Overall, says Bogert, social media gives Human RIghts Watch the ability to turn the information it collects and the research it produces into levers for action and positive change.

As communicators, we all hunger for the magic list of “to-dos” that will make us game changers.

Sometimes, though, we have to start by admitting that what we’re doing is wrong before we can do it right.

Take, for example, videos produced to advance social causes. So many fail – no matter the worthy cause or deserving individuals they’re meant to help – simply because they are unwatchable.

Speaking last year at the frank 2014 gathering in Gainesville, filmmakers Kristina Robbins and Marjan Safinia, from the <a href="http://departmentofexpansion.com/" target="_blank">Departmentof Expansion</a>, attributed that problem to bad scripting. Something that goes like this:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Act One:</strong>  Depress and overwhelm your audience with greats facts and realities that make them feel powerless, and maybe even, guilty.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Act Two</strong>: Have an executive use lots of jargon to explain the mission statement, cram in a couple of talking points and maybe list some programs.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Act Three:</strong> Tell people how the work your organization does--none of which viewers will actually be able to experience--truly creates hope and changes lives.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A better approach, they say, is to create movies that tell interesting stories and that take people on a journey that ends someplace different from where they started. And let viewers draw their own conclusions.</p>
According to Robbins and Safinia, when used properly, tools of documentary storytelling can help engage, surprise and bring new audiences to your cause.

Watch the video below and learn how to make films that hook audiences, draw them in and get them to do what you want.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been working in the field of social change communications for a long time, and over the years I've seen various efforts to measure--even define--success. Then, on the final day of the <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/frank-2015-recap/" target="_blank">frank2015 conference</a>, I heard Frank Karel Fellow Yoo-Jin Kang say during her talk:
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>Success in public interest communications starts when people say 'OMG this is important!'</em></p>
It's hard to argue that point because, without some recognition or acknowledgment that what people are hearing, seeing or being asked to respond to "is important," there's not much more to say after that. We need what we're saying to be considered important if we're going to make progress toward taming global warming, advancing the marriage equality cause, closing the gender gap, fighting obesity, and the myriad other battles waged daily to make the good greater for as many as possible.
<em>
So, how do you make people know what you say is important?
</em>
Perhaps, not surprisingly, there is no single answer. Just lots of pathways, guidance and suggestions-- much based on practice and, in recent years, a growing amount of new knowledge coming from researchers who are studying how people receive information and process messages, what works, what doesn't, as well as what merits more investigation.

frank's purpose is to be a convener, connector and, yes, cheerleader for using communications to advance social good. Our annual conference, which is just one of the ways we perform our service to the field of public interest communications, brought together a rich mix of practicing communications professionals from nonprofits, foundations, think tanks and consulting firms, as well as journalists, artists and academics, among others.

Any effort on my part to tell you what was "important" about what people said or heard at frank, would barely do justice to the depth of insights and wisdom around which the conversations centered. Because of the strong desire to address how to use communications effectively to "make the good greater," there was a conscious effort to explore the topic through a range of lenses: practitioner, academic and even observer.

The takeaways from frank were many, and much of it thought-provoking and both actionable and applicable.

But don't just take my word for it. Instead, pull up a chair -- and away from the latest season of “House of Cards" -- and binge instead on our <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/clips/" target="_blank">collection of memorable videos from #frank2015</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>When It Comes To Effective Communications, Sometimes Timing Is Everything</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You've got to hand it to the smart people at <a href="http://thebulletin.org/" target="_blank">the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a>, home to the iconic <em><a href="http://thebulletin.org/overview" target="_blank">Doomsday Clock</a>,</em> which for six decades has been telling the world how close we're coming to the brink of annihilation.

[caption id="attachment_8625" align="alignright" width="200"]<img class="wp-image-8625 size-full" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Kennette-Benedict.jpg" alt="Kennette-Benedict" width="200" height="200" /> Kennette Benedict[/caption]

What makes the group's work so effective is that its message -- and means of communicating it -- haven't changed over the years. They use a method that's simple, powerful and impossible to ignore.

Whenever the Bulletin wants to tell the world how close we are to (or distant from) ultimate peril, it resets the minute hand of the Doomsday Clock -- basing that judgment on what a team of scientists and analysts have concluded about how well we're addressing everything from threats from nuclear arms to climate change. The closer to <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_763387698"><span class="aQJ">midnight</span></span> the greater the peril. The further away, the more time we have to take action. In January, for instance, the clock's minute hand was moved forward again -- from five to three minutes, where it had been since 2012 -- due to fear of an out-of-control arms race and lack of action on global warming.

Kennette Benedict, who served as executive director the Bulletin from 2005 until she retired in February 2015, recently offered a fascinating overview of the Doomsday Clock that's worth reading. She covers everything from the clock's birth in 1947 to who decides what time it is to the first time it was reset.

Among the many interesting tidbits she shares is that the clock's minute hand was set the farthest from midnight in 1991 -- all the way back to 17 minutes -- to mark the easing of tensions resulting from the end of the Cold War. Another fun fact is that for the first iteration of the clock, the time was set to seven minutes to midnight because designer Martyl Langsdorf said “it looked good to my eye.”

Benedict touches on a lot in her discussion about the clock, but one of the very important insights she offers is how the Bulletin works overtime to ensure the clock isn't seen as "just a scare tactic used to advance a political agenda." As she puts it:
<blockquote><i>The Bulletin has moved the Clock hand away from midnight almost as often as it has moved it toward, and as often during Republican administrations in the United States as during Democratic ones. </i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>Ensuring the survival of our societies and the human species is not a political agenda. Cooperating with other countries to achieve control of extremely dangerous technologies should not involve partisan politics. If scientists involved with the Bulletin are critical of current policies on nuclear weapons and climate change, it is because those policies increase the possibility of self-destruction.
</i></blockquote>
If you have some time on your hands, <a href="http://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clockwork8052" target="_blank">take a look for yourself</a>.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This post is adapted from a version which appeared on the Spitfire Strategies website <a href="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/reflections-from-frank-2015/" target="_blank">here.</a></em>

We live in a rapidly changing world where information travels at the speed of light—and to be effective communicators, we must continuously evolve our thinking and break free from convention. That’s exactly what this year’s <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/" target="_blank"><em>frank</em></a> gathering was all about.

Some of the most talented and forward-thinking public interest communicators met for three days to discuss how together, we can better create a healthier, safer and more just world.

Now that may sound like some nebulous or fluffy ideal, but let me tell you—there’s something truly magical that happens when visionaries from across the field come together with the sole purpose to share, learn and grow with one another. You get to see how a spark of an idea or a fleeting notion can transform into something that changes lives forever.

I was privileged to hear from speakers such as Chad Boettcher from <a href="http://www.participantmedia.com/about-ushttp://" target="_blank">Participant Media</a> about how a good story, well told, can change the world. I learned from <a href="https://vimeo.com/121081128" target="_blank">Chip Giller</a> of Grist about using humor to engage people in the climate change fight. Shankar Vedantam taught me more about overcoming <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2014/07/28/333945706/why-we-think-ignorance-is-bliss-even-when-it-hurts-our-health" target="_blank">information aversion</a> and Bobby Jones made me a believer that <a href="https://vimeo.com/120885605" target="_blank">good really is the new cool</a>. I also gained a renewed sense of hope—that the fight doesn’t end with my colleagues and me. There is a new, bright, dedicated, passionate and diverse set of young people eager to create social change. I had the opportunity to hear from several <a href="https://vimeo.com/120885697" target="_blank">student fellows</a> about what drives them and why this work really matters.

After all the f<em>rank</em> talks, the incredible presentations and the conversations over coffee, I walked away feeling inspired and with three major lessons that I will carry forward:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://vimeo.com/120885703" target="_blank">Satire and snark</a> are our friends. In the age of the Daily Show and Stephen Colbert, we can rally our audiences through humor and make complex issues more palatable.</li>
	<li>Consumers are hungry for products and services that make a difference. It’s up to us to help corporations and the private sector make those connections, and use their profit for progress.</li>
	<li>Being proactive with your story is an absolute must—<a href="https://vimeo.com/120729669" target="_blank">information moves so quickly</a> that unless you’re in control of your narrative from the start, it’s hard to shape it once your opposition has picked it up.</li>
</ul>
I’m grateful for having had the chance to soak up this wisdom from some of the brightest social interest minds. It was invigorating to be around so many people that share the same passions, and who are committed to lifelong learning and collaboration.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It's been several weeks since the frank 2015 gathering and I still find myself re-reading the pages of notes I took on the ideas, insights and inspirations I heard over the course of the gathering.

In the spirit of frank's mission to "connect people who speak for the greater good"-- and to keep the conversation going--here are some takeaways I keep coming back to and you might, too:

<strong>Yup. Storytelling is still important</strong>. Chad Boettcher, executive vice president of social action and advocacy at Participant Media told us that "a good story can change the world," a theme that echoed throughout the conference. Whether used to foster empathy for an issue, provide a window to understand a social problem or put a human face on numbers, storytelling can move a message forward. Similarly, Ai-Jen Poo, author of “The Age of Dignity” and the director of Domestic Works told us that "we are an interconnected web of relationships, and storytelling opens that up for us."

Carlos Roig, media and content strategist at Home Front Communications, encouraged us to learn from the way newsrooms have crafted stories for centuries. Journalists, he argued, have the skills to tell stories that attract attention, fill gaps in the public's understanding of an issue, make sense of and translate research in a way that is accessible to the reader and delineate a clear path to change. Roig advised us to do our research, or as he put it, "understand an issue down to its bones. . . and then craft a solution." Once we understand the issue at hand, we can craft stories that "meet audiences where they are, speak in their own language and propel them to the change we envision.” By harnessing the principles of journalism, Roig argued that we can artfully tell stories with clarity and depth.

<strong>Meet people where they are. </strong>Any message or campaign seeking to reach the hearts and minds of an audience has to start on their level. For example, the winner of a $1,500 frank research prize, social psychologist Dr. Viviane Seyranian of California Polytechnic University, Pomona, showed us that if we want to move people to action we have to speak to their sense of self and their identities – like political affiliation, gender, age and occupation. We must present the message and messenger as representative of our audience's identity, through inclusive language such as "we" and “us."

Another $1500 frank prize winner, social psychologist Dr. Sleeth-Keppler at Humboldt State University, similarly reminded us that <em>who</em> delivers the message is just as important as the message itself. If we are to reach disparate audiences that may be adverse to the campaign message, we must rely on trusted local leaders to gain people’s support. Such individuals may include church leaders, doctors, farmers and neighbors. As Sleeth-Keppler notes, "The messenger <em>is</em> the message."

<strong>Progress doesn't have to be perfect</strong>. We have to work with those who have resources to make long-lasting change. For example, Rich Neimand and Dave Clayton of Neimand Collaborative discussed a MasterCard public education campaign designed to provide economically disadvantaged and marginalized populations with access to financial services. The target populations, many of them Latino and African-American families, have little access to debit cards, credit cards, savings accounts and other financial services that provide minimal financial security. That limits their upward mobility, produces a second-class status, and can actually cost more because of additional fees for routine things like getting checks cashed. By partnering with MasterCard to produce debit cards that enables employers to directly deposit paychecks, for instance, this for-profit company is making substantial social change. As Rich Neimand noted, "If you want to create change, you have to work all of the angles… politics, policy and people. And you have to play in the marketplace. Markets aren't perfect, and we don't create perfect change, but this change can be more transformative than working with spare change to create perfection."

<strong>Don't be afraid to speak volumes. </strong>Great communications requires skill, passion and gall. Whether it is sharing personal struggles to inspire a community or tirelessly working to build a drumbeat for the cause, the frank 2015 speakers showed us that to create change, we can't be afraid to speak volumes.

For example, Jenny Lawson, better known to her followers as the “Bloggess,” talked about the transformative power of online communities. Through sharing her own experience with mental illness and overcoming fears through her own blogging and in her bestselling book <em>Let's Pretend This Never Happened</em>, she inspired an online community to come together and support and empower each other.<strong> </strong>

Anastasia Khoo, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign (HRC), discussed her decision to change HRC's iconic blue and yellow equal sign symbol to red and pink – "the color of love” – as part of the group’s campaign for marriage equality. This color change triggered a viral response that far exceeded the organization’s expectations and became the most successful of its kind in the history of Facebook.

The switch was timed to coincide with the then upcoming Supreme Court cases on marriage equality. Every day for six months leading up to decision in 2012, HRC “had a singular focus about building a drumbeat," said Khoo. While the logo switch was part of a larger and highly strategic effort, the new design happened because Khoo decided to just do it. “One of the keys to success is not ask anybody,” she said. But the biggest takeaway from Khoo’s talk is applicable to all social change efforts: "If you don't treat it like a big deal, your audience won’t either."

<strong>Have a Plan. </strong>Strategic communications is nothing without a plan, whether it is in the execution of a story or the building of a campaign.

For example, Jim Ross and Jennifer Webber, strategists who worked on the Lift Up Oakland campaign, a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage and provide paid sick days in Oakland, California, discussed how they used earned media to build support for the campaign. Relying on what they learned from polling, they designed a campaign that “drove the discussion,” where they were advocating and not responding to the opposition. The campaign had a large amount of media coverage, with a story published every three days until election day.

As a result, the ballot measure was passed and the minimum wage was raised to $12.25, and five to nine paid sick days were mandated.

Ross and Webber taught us to be transparent with our supporters and give them the tools – such as talking points, so they can be boots on the ground – and make campaign and messaging resources readily available to media outlets for coverage.

The frank gathering--<em>like everything we do at frank</em>--is about connecting those in the business of doing good so that we can make the good greater. As we keep learning, we'll keep sharing here on the frank website and again, next year at #frank2016.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>3 Lessons for Nonprofit Writers from Harvard’s Steven Pinker</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/04/3-lessons-for-nonprofit-writers-from-harvards-steven-pinker/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>A version of this post originally appeared on the Prichard website <a href="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/featured-home/3-lessons-for-nonprofit-writers-from-harvards-steven-pinker-at-frank-2015/" target="_blank">here</a>.</em>

The nonprofit world has more than its fair share of bad writing. Impenetrable jargon, run-on sentences, and bloated paragraphs are everywhere in our reports, proposals and other documents.

Giving our coworkers our industry “go to” Strunk and White’s classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style" target="_blank">“The Elements of Style</a>” isn’t the answer, Harvard linguistics professor Steven Pinker told the audience at <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/">frank 2015</a>. The problem: Traditional guides like this one draw on the tastes of the authors themselves, contain contradictory and outdated advice, and don’t reflect changes in usage.

Pinker says there’s another way. Instead of repeating rules of grammar and usage that draw on myths and misunderstanding, we should look instead at the evidence for what makes for effective writing.

Pinker makes his case in a guidebook of his own, <a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/sense-style-thinking-persons-guide-writing-21st-century" target="_blank">“The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person’s Guide to Writing in the 21st Century.”</a>  In addition to discussing the science of language and the history of rules of grammar and usage, Pinker gives practical advice every writer can use.  It’s an enjoyable, funny book that will appeal to communicators and professionals alike.

Here are three of my favorite lessons from Pinker’s book and talk that can help all nonprofit writers now.

<b>Beware the Curse of Knowledge</b>

We assume everybody understands our subject. “It’s the best explanation of why good people write bad prose,” says Pinker.

How do you avoid this trap? Traditionalists say we should imagine the reader over our shoulder. Pinker sees merit in this, but argues, too, for awareness of the problems caused by curse of knowledge: use of jargon, abbreviations and technical terms.

Too many nonprofit writers think it’s a sign of professional weakness to explain professional terms like acronyms or use a short word instead of one with multiple syllables.  Your writing will be much clearer — and your readers grateful — if you keep your language simple and concrete.

<b>Stop Hedging</b>

“Many writers cushion their prose with ways of fluff that imply they are not willing to stand behind what they are saying,” says Pinker.

One of the most common ways I see nonprofit writers do this: using words like almost, apparently, in part, nearly and somewhat. The next time you edit your writing, draw a line through these words, especially adverbs. You text will be much stronger.

<b>Delete the Shudder Quotes</b>

Quotation marks have legitimate uses, says Pinker, such as citing what someone has said or indicating that a writer doesn’t agree the meaning of word as it is used by others.

Many authors, however, use quotes around phrases like “think outside the box” or “young turks.” The result, says Pinker, is self-conscious and prissy writing. “If you’re not comfortable using an expression without apologetic quotation marks,” says Pinker, “you probably shouldn’t be using it all."]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Let&#039;s Hear It For The Obsessive Dynamo Who Gives Voice To frank</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Public interest communicators spend a lot of time with words. Framing language that drives strategy. Stories that engage audiences. Statements that inspire action. We deeply believe that words can save lives and make the world a better place.

As the first-ever chair in public interest communications, Ann Christiano is pretty obsessed with words. But she’s even more obsessed with the values behind the words. The respect that she feels for all points of view manifests when she asks everyone, “What do <em>you</em> think?” The inclusion that she champions is evident as she strives to build a big-tent definition of this growing communications field. And her warmth is evident behind every “yes” she says when colleagues want to collaborate and students ask for help.

When she isn’t teaching, Ann has managed to pull off two inspiring frank gatherings which have grown in size and reputation as the “go to” place for those who see public interest communication as a force for good in the world.

So it’s no surprise…<em>drum roll</em>…that the <a href="http://www.jou.ufl.edu/news/2015/04/06/ann-christiano-named-ufs-2014-2015-teacher-of-the-year/" target="_blank">University of Florida named Ann as its teacher of the year</a>. That’s not just UF’s College of Journalism and Communications, but <em>the entire university</em>.

It’s been our absolute pleasure to watch Ann identify her charge to create curriculum, encourage a body of research and connect practitioners to further build this new field. Sure, we think it’s cool because we do this type of work. But we find it especially fantastic that she’s embraced this charge with a commitment to these values, a belief that damn-near anything is possible and a focus on having students alongside her for every step of the way. We’ve watched her challenge Gators in the classroom, push them to take on professional roles for <em>frank</em> and place them in jobs across the country. She doesn’t say goodbye to students when they complete her class. Ann fully expects that she’ll see them again, because they’ll become a part of the industry that she’s building.

Well, Ann, you’re right. Our numbers are growing in this industry, and that means more voices speaking for the greater good. Those voices start by asking, “Are we creating awareness?” Ann teaches them that awareness isn’t enough. It’s action that matters, and she models that every day. Thank you, Ann, for inspiring your students and so many more of us.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Oregon “franksters” Reflect on #frank2015 Experience</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/04/oregon-franksters-reflect-on-frank2015-experience/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This piece originally appeared on the <a href="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/featured-home/oregon-franksters-reflect-on-frank2015-experience/" target="_blank">Prichard website</a>.</em>

Earlier this week, Team Prichard convened a cohort of fellow Oregonians who attended <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/">frank 2015</a> to drink wine, eat coconut macaroons, reconnect and reflect on what we learned.

Our Pacific Northwest community of franksters was so excited to get together, in fact, we made our own logo for the occasion:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-3595" src="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/frankoregonlogo.png" alt="frank Oregon logo" width="721" height="447" />We knew we wanted to share our Oregon frank experience with the broader frank community, so we put together an activity for our happy hour “Krewe” that generated some thinking about the conference.

We asked our fellow happy hour-ers to help us fill in some statements about their frank experience, such as…

“My favorite speaker at #frank2015 was ______________________”

Popular answers to that question included <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mrbobbyjones">Bobby Jones</a>, <a href="http://www.hrc.org/staff/profile/anastasia-khoo">Anastasia Khoo</a>, <a href="http://thebloggess.com/">The Bloggess</a> and <a href="http://lizzwinstead.com/">Lizz Winstead</a>, and in addition, an adamant shout out for <a href="http://www.asocommunications.com/html/">Anat Shenker-Osorio</a>.

Also, we ask the group to reflect on what inspired them coming away from frank 2015. Responses included:
<ul>
	<li>“Stephen Pinker… to write well better!”</li>
	<li>“So many people driven to make REAL and positive change”</li>
	<li>“How wonderfully humble all these amazing people were–clearly a curated group!”</li>
	<li>“The energy and enthusiasm of the students”</li>
</ul>
My favorite reflection however was when we asked our colleagues to define frank:

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-3597" src="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/frankoregonnotes11.png" alt="frank Oregon notes" width="623" height="559" />

Responses (pictured) were creative, thoughtful and essentially disparate, underscoring my personal feeling that frank is not simply an easily defined conference, but rather a broader <em>movement</em> to help align, rally and inspire public interest communicators across the United States…. a “short sweet and lovely” movement that we can bet its namesake, <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/about/frank-karel/">Frank Karel</a>, would be proud of!

And the only thing missing from our micro-movement of franksters was our honorary Oregonian, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennyjpark">Jenny Park</a>! We missed you, Jenny!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently picked up the book “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/switch-change-things-when-hard/dp/0385528752" target="_blank">Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard</a>,” by bestselling authors Chip and Dan Heath. The book is filled with lots of useful insights for anyone working to advance social causes. But what stood out for me was a metaphor (originally used by social psychologist Jonathan Haidt in his book, "<a href="http://www.happinesshypothesis.com/" target="_blank">The Happiness Hypothesis</a>"). This metaphor likens the process of making lasting change to riding an elephant

Chip Heath <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/organization/making_the_emotional_case_for_change_an_interview_with_chip_heath" target="_blank">elaborated in a 2010 interview</a>: “The Rider represents our analytical, planning side. The Rider decides, ‘I need to go somewhere. Here’s the direction I want to go,’ and sets off. But it’s the Elephant, the emotional side, that’s providing the power. The Rider can try to lead the Elephant, but in any direct contest of wills the Elephant is going to win — it has a six-ton advantage. So part of achieving change, in either our lives or in organizations, is aligning both sides of the brain by pointing out the direction for the Rider but also motivating the Elephant to undertake the journey. Of course, the Path the Elephant walks down matters, too. High-ranking executives can shape that Path, that environment and make the journey easier even when the Elephant is less motivated.”

Change happens when we can align the emotion-driven elephant with the rational rider, so long as we provide a clear path for change. According to the Heaths, improving the ability to reach the head (rider) and the heart (elephant) is fundamental for creating long-lasting change.

I recognize that the head and heart concept is not new — just ask any public interest communicator. But, as I thought more about the idea, it occurred to me how frequently that concept also appears in communications research, including many of the studies featured in the <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/" target="_blank">frankology </a>section of our website.

What stands out most, though, is that this interplay — between our rational and emotional selves — does not play out the same way for everyone. Nuances abound.

People are poles apart on climate change, for example, despite overwhelming scientific evidence that global warming is real. Dan Kahan, the Elizabeth K. Dollard Professor of Law &amp; Professor of Psychology at Yale Law School, found that this polarization has less to do with knowledge of science and more to do with cultural identity. In a study published in the April 2012 issue of <em>N</em><em>a</em><em>ture</em>, Kahan argues that people are less willing to accept scientific evidence if it runs counter to “how they see themselves.” In other words, if it is in their best interest to deny evidence, then denial becomes the rational choice.

Kahan further maintains that the “public divisions over climate change stem not from the public’s incomprehension of science but from a distinctive conflict of interest: between the personal interest individuals have in forming beliefs in line with those held by others with whom they share close ties and the collective one they all share in making use of the best available science to promote common welfare.”

Just as our rational side, our “head,” can be influenced by factors such as identity, so can our heart. In a <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/40/12/1559">study</a> published in the November 2014 Personality and Psychology Bulletin, Dr. Martin Day, Harvard fellow in the Department of Psychology, and his colleagues found that what we consider “moral” is shaped by our political affiliations. Day’s work suggests that liberals tend to favor values of avoiding harm and promoting equality, while conservatives tend to favor values of respect for authority, protection of the in-group and preserving the sacred. People are more likely to support political stances that speak to their sense of morality, and thus are moved emotionally by different moral framing.

Research suggests that if we want to move people emotionally, we must speak to their own personal sense of morality, which, as demonstrated, is tied to identity. If we want to reach disparate elephants and riders, then we need strategies that speak to differently motivated heads and hearts.

This tension between head and heart often plays out in whom people trust as sources of information. David Sleeth-Keppler of Humbolt State University and Robert Perkowitz and Meighen Speiser of ecoAmerica, winners of a 2015 frank prize for public interest communications research, found that many people, especially those with deep religious and conservative beliefs, are more likely to rely on informal communicators (co-workers, religious leaders, family members and neighbors) for information and insight on issues like climate change, rather than formal communicators like government officials.

Speaking at the frank 2015 conference, Sleeth-Keppler cited <a href="http://blessedtomorrow.org" target="_blank">Blessed Tomorrow</a>, a group that uses faith-based narratives and religious leaders to call people to action on issues of climate change. The group brings together pastors to talk about climate change as a religious value of conservation and to ask their congregations to “walk more gently on the earth and inspire others to lead on climate solutions in their homes, congregations and communities.” In this case, Blessed Tomorrow seeks to reach the head and the heart of those who are influenced by their religious affiliation.

In short, research suggests that we need to consider strategies that use individual identities and their relative sense of rationality and morality to speak to diverse audiences. To create long-lasting and meaningful change, we need to motivate the elephant, direct the rider and clear a path. We can do this by speaking to the head and the heart of our audiences — and their various shades of grey.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Rebranding The Single Mom</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[One afternoon while I was doing research on gender and income inequality, I came across the name Cara Lemieux, digital media strategist for The Shriver Report--“a nonpartisan initiative that raises awareness, ignites conversations and inspires impact around the deﬁning issues and fundamental changes facing modern women and their families.”

After reading about her online, I learned that Lemieux spent part of her career as a network control room producer at ABC News for “Good Morning America.” She then moved to ABC News Digital where she helped produce the <i>Stand Up for Heroes</i> campaign with Bob Woodruff, a digital video series that paired up high profile mentors with veterans making the transition back to civilian life. Later, she joined The Shriver Report, where she helped launch the group’s digital platforms and ran social media campaigns. Now she heads her own firm, <a href="http://caralemieux.com">CPL communications</a>, is a contributing writer to sites such as SheKnows.com and Lifetime Moms and she is passionate about rebranding the single mom, which is both the subject and focus of her blog, “<a href="http://hereweare.today">Here We are Today.</a>”

In her Tedx talk, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5P6NBk6P4">Rebranding the Single Mom</a>,” she discusses the single mother stereotype, her experience with an unplanned pregnancy, her growing identity crises, and how she deals with and works to end feelings of isolation and stigma.

[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN5P6NBk6P4[/embed]

As Lemieux prepared to bring her daughter into the world, she struggled with the stigma attached to her newly acquired title. “It is not like single mothers are painted in a great light in the media,” explained Lemieux in her Tedx talk. “We have all seen the headlines: ‘Finally city to tackle unwed moms epidemic,’ or ‘Are single mothers to blame for sons’ poor grades? Our readers weigh in.’” Lemieux also felt stigma from her peers. “There was no shortage of commentary around me, ranging from ‘No one is ever going to want to hire a single mom,’ to ‘How can someone so smart be so dumb?’”

Once her daughter came into her life, she grappled with her seemingly incompatible “brand identities” — network news producer and single mom. But, as she struggled to make sense of this conflict, she knew that she was not alone.  “I knew there were so many women doing so much more with so much less,” explained Lemieux. “After meeting and talking to other single moms, I realized the reflection of us in the media isn’t necessarily accurate, we love our kids just like married moms, we have a work-life internal debate just like married moms, we show up for our kids and are doing the best we can just like married moms…I came to the conclusion… that the single mom needs a rebranding.”

After watching her Tedx talk, I called Lemieux to learn more about her work with women’s issues and digital media strategy.

”Very few women plan on being single mothers,” she said. “When I first got pregnant, I struggled with the label and the connotations that came with it, and then I had this whole branding conflict. You know, how I could be this accomplished, smart news producer and a single mom, like how do those things co-exist? But in reality, they do.”

Lemieux went on to say that “the only way to rebrand something like this is through storytelling. If you get enough people saying, ‘Hey that’s not me, that is not a representation of my life — then the public perception will have to shift, [but] it may take awhile.”

Lemieux uses <a href="http://hereweare.today/single-motherhood/">her blog</a> to share her experiences, struggles and triumphs as a single mom. In the section, “<a href="http://hereweare.today/rebranding-the-single-mom/">Rebranding of the Single Mom</a>,” Lemieux also features stories from other single moms and dads.

Sharing stories about single mothers as well as fathers is a strategic one. “Framing of issues always lays on the mom. We need to do a better job at including the full family in that conversation. You have to include men in these conversations,” argued Lemieux. “We need to be more inclusive with the way we frame the conversation.” Lemieux cites the current <i>Lean In</i> conversation, centered around Sheryl Sandberg’s book of the same name, as an example of an effort missing an opportunity to speak to single parents and diverse families.

Lemieux also feels social media is key to the work she’s doing – both her own project and the professional ones she has worked on.

For example, to coincide with the release of The Shriver Report’s “Paycheck to Paycheck” – a documentary that followed a single mom struggling to take care of herself and her family — Lemieux worked with the Shriver Report team to create an online conversation focused on issues of income inequality by using the hashtags #whatwomenneed and #womendoingitall. In addition to inviting women to talk about the challenges they faced, she used the hashtag campaign to crowdsource the kind of help they needed. The campaign #doingitall was featured on the <i>Today</i> show and <a href="http://NBC.com">NBC.com</a>, and the campaign #whatwomenneed had more than 108 million impressions from Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. It also produced over 27,000 posts on Twitter, and received endorsements from President Barack Obama, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and celebrities like Oprah, Bette Midler, Melinda Gates, Ben Affleck and others.

Lemieux’s advice for those working to address other social issues? Use social media “to develop and foster conversations” around issues. “If you don’t [use social media], you are missing a very accessible tool. The audiences are already there. You have to reach them. You have to think specifically how to cater the social media platform to them. I can’t think of anything lately that has been successful that hasn't used social media.”

As our conversation came to an end, Lemieux took a deep breath, and shared her thoughts on the role of communications in advancing social change: “I think communication has the ability to really make life better. I truly believe that without communication, there is nothing.”

		<title>The Science Of Communication: An interview with Dr. Sara Bleich, 2015 frank grand prize winner</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>“We, as academics, are really well trained in how to do rigorous research, but often that rigorous research has real world information that has to be disseminated in a meaningful way."  –Sara Bleich, winner 2015 frank research prize.</blockquote>
Soon we’ll be taking submissions for the frank 2016 research prizes in public interest communications. Our prizes recognize new and insightful academic research that will inform better public interest communication practice. Each year three finalists are brought to the frank gathering to present their research and compete for a $10,000 prize. The frank audience votes for the $10K winner, and our two other finalists each receive $1500.

To kick things off, we thought we would start by talking with the 2015 frank prize winner, Dr. Sara Bleich. Bleich received her PhD from Harvard in 2007 in health policy, and is now an associate professor at John Hopkins University. You may have heard Bleich on NPR talking about her <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/campaign-to-lower-calorie-intake-produces-sweet-results/">award winning research</a>. In it, she and her colleagues examined the effectiveness of using easily understandable information to get black youth to buy fewer surgery beverages in corner stores in Baltimore city. Bleich, a native of Baltimore city, focused particularly on black youth because, on average, they drink larger amounts of sugary beverages, and are at higher risk for obesity.

In the study, they put up informational signs in local corner stores that showed the customers how many miles and how much time they would have to walk to burn off the calories from a soda. What they found was that not only did access to easily understandable information lead to decreases in purchases of soda, but the kids continued to purchase fewer sodas even after they took down the signs.

This research is insightful because it shows that easily understandable information matters, but more importantly it shows that kids can learn how to improve their health and make better choices. This project provides evidence of a very low cost public health intervention, as well as insight into the effectiveness of strategic messaging.

I called Sara to talk with her about her work in public health and its relationship to the field of public interest communications. I also asked her what it was like to attend frank, and win the $10,000 frank research prize. Check it out!

Annie: How did you get into the field of public health and health policy?

Sara: Public health is one of those really interesting fields where many people come from different disciplines. It is not uncommon to learn about this field post graduate school or post training. Like many public health people, I started off thinking I wanted to be a physician. I took the pre-med classes, but I quickly realized that it really wasn't the thing that go me excited and made me tick. While I was an undergraduate I did a summer abroad in Zimbabwe. While I was there I was one of 17 Americans and we all lived with host families in the capital city. Each of our host families had someone die during that period of the HIV epidemic. It was then that I felt for the first time the impact of health on wellbeing. I came back to New York, where I was doing my undergraduate work at Columbia University, thinking I love the idea of helping lots of people at one time, not helping a person individually on a case by case basis, but again I had never heard about public health. So I graduated and ended up falling into a job that I now know of as public health consulting. I did that for a couple of years, really fell in love with it, and decided to get a degree in health policy.  All the work that I do is with an eye towards how to use policy and communications to help people live healthier lives.

A: What do you think is the relationship between public health and public interest communications?

S: I think public health can learn a lot from public interest communications. I think a huge handicap for people that do academic research in public health and other fields, is that we, as academics, are really well trained in how to do rigorous research, but often that rigorous research has real world information that has to be disseminated in a meaningful way. What public health is trying to do at its core is save lives, its trying to improve peoples quality of life, and it is hard to do that if the information that is meant to touch people never does. I think public interest communications can create that bridge. It can identify the ways to take complicated messages and make them simple and digestible, and disseminate them to the people whose lives we are trying to affect.

A: You are getting me so excited for the field of public interest communications! So, what was it like submitting your research to frank?

S: It was very easy! There certainly aren’t big barriers to entry. I simply had to submit the original abstract, the abstract for the lay audience, and then the paper itself. It took less then a half an hour to submit. Then, I was notified that I was a finalist. I think the time between submitting and being notified was a couple months, so not that long by academic standards. It was a painless process, there is no reason someone shouldn't engage in it.

A: What was it like attending frank?

S: One of the things I enjoyed most about frank was the opportunity to be among people of so many different fields. In my world, I am usually surrounded by academics that tend to all think a certain way. It is not common that I am around people with expertise in media; this was a conference where I learned much more than I had at other conferences, it took me out of my comfort zone to an area that I need to grow.

So, if you are considering it at all, apply. You will not lose anything by trying. The competition for the prize is great, but it is also an opportunity to actually improve and grow, particularly if what you do is not in communications, you get a lot out of it regardless if you win the prize.

A: What was it like presenting at frank?

S: I thought it was so much fun! I like the idea of being forced to present in a specific amount of time. If there was one thing I learned in graduate school, it is that less is more and that precision is really important. So, the challenge of having to say a lot in eight minutes is an important skill to work towards, and having the opportunity to try that was really fun for me. I also like the challenge of having to really talk everyone through the research. Rather than just putting up statistics, it was really using pictures and images to compel the audience, and that was something I have never had done before, it was an interesting challenge.

A: So do you think you learned something about communications through your talk?

S: Absolutely. It also really reenforced for me something that I know well, and that is that you have to reach your audience. If the frank audience had been a different audience, if they had been academics it would have been a very different talk. But, they weren't academics, they were groups whom I have never presented to before,  so that required a very different style of presenting.

I should say that Burness Communications, which is a public interest communications firm, took it upon themselves to pro-bono provide me with guidance on the front end, and helped me do a better job at presenting at frank. They gave me guidance and it was tremendously valuable for me.

A: That’s awesome! Sounds like a great learning experience. So how did it feel to win the $10,000 prize?

S: It was so rewarding  for so many different reasons. One of the reasons is, I focused on inner city, Baltimore City because I grew up there, and I know those corner stores so well. As a kid, I know what it’s like to buy junk from the stores, and as a result, gain weight. So on a personal level it was hugely gratifying to be recognized for giving back to a community that I am from, and that I am personally committed to trying to improve. The other piece is, you typically go into public health research because, in your own little way, you want to change the world, you want to make people healthier, you want to do your small part. To have the recognition by people, who really know the role of communication in changing minds, acknowledge this project as something that was moving in that direction was a huge note of encouragement for this work, which is not easy to do, but really important.

A: What was the first thing you did after you found out you won the prize?

S: I texted my husband and he was thrilled! The first person I hugged was someone from my frank krewe. She gave me a great big hug, and that was really nice.

I have to say, the other thing about frank is it was the most fun conference I have ever been to. I remember before going into the scavenger hunt thinking this is either going to be really fun or really lame, and it was one of the most fun things.

A: Cool! It sounds like you were able to make good connections with your krewe.

S: We did! The first night of the scavenger hunt was a bonding experience, and then of course throughout the conference. Just the other day there were emails circulating throughout the group.

You know, between the level of energy among the frank attendees, and the huge emphasis on networking, I think that the conference was very thoughtful at creating places for people to talk to each other, rather than being talk at the whole time.

At the risk of sounding too much like a frank lover, I’d say one of the things that I really enjoyed about frank was an expressed focus on time to connect people in all sorts of ways. There were all these direct and indirect ways of trying to connect people.

A: That’s awesome! You know the frank mission is: obsessively connecting those who speak for the greater good.

S: Yes, exactly. That is what you guys do well.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A large part of being a public interest communicator is getting inspired.

Consuming research, new perspectives, pop culture, books and art all strengthen a communicator’s ability to craft messages, understand new audiences and launch campaigns that effect change.

Plus, summer is settling in and there’s nothing quite like flipping pages of a new book while kicking back in a hammock or just laying in bed with a breeze sailing through. Check out these five summer reads that will inspire your social change work.
<ol>
	<li><b><a href="http://apathappears.org/book/"><b>A Path Appears: Transforming Lives, Creating Opportunity</b></a> by Nick Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Delivering an inspirational roadmap to driving social change, the husband-and-wife duo shed light on oppression faced by women and girls around the world, and the people who are changing it. On the heels of their previous book, <a href="http://www.halftheskymovement.org/pages/book">Half the Sky</a> (also a worthwhile companion to a summer evening) The New York Times columnist Kristoff teams up with a <a href="https://vimeo.com/120628765">frank 2015 speaker WuDunn</a> to share on-the-ground reporting of successful individuals and groups advancing social progress, inspiring readers to combat injustices.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong><a href="http://atulgawande.com/book/being-mortal/">Being Mortal</a></strong> <b>by Atul Gawande</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As a surgeon, Atul Gawande has worked on the frontlines of medical treatment, but what he found when he confronted our processes for caring for elderly populations was <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/book-review-being-mortal-by-atul-gawande-1413501104">disturbing</a>. In his thought provoking <a href="http://atulgawande.com/books/">fourth book challenging the modern American medical system</a>, Gawande explores the elder care system, and how it is failing to support the wellbeing of our nation’s oldest citizens — their choices, their freedom and their anxieties about death. Currently on my nightstand, Being Mortal offers an eye-opening, human-centered reality check for us to shift our thinking about how to live a fulfilling life even into old age.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><b><a href="http://stevenpinker.com/publications/better-angels-our-nature"><b>The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined</b></a> by Steven Pinker</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Intersecting history, psychology and social change, this book is an inspiring look at how our moral direction has evolved. Steven Pinker, a frank 2015 speaker and Harvard researcher, takes a long journey back into the history of violence, examining how it has decreased since the 20th century and why human nature leads us towards a peaceful society. Pinker credits the spread of government, literacy, trade and cosmopolitanism as keys to this social progress, making us more empathetic toward one another.</p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><b><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246980/a-force-for-good-by-daniel-goleman/"><b>A Force for Good: The Dalai Lama’s Vision for our World</b></a> by Daniel Goleman</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Reflecting on current social issues through the lens of compassion, Goleman applies the Dalai Lama’s teachings to transforming the world in practical ways. He shares how compassion can impact systems change, such as designing schools that teach empathy and rewarding transparency and accountability in business practices. <i>A Force for Good </i>will inspire a stronger approach to compassion in your work.</p>

<ol start="5">
	<li><b><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591843162/permissionmarket"><b>Linchpin: Are You Indispensable?</b></a> by Seth Godin</b></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Marketer and entrepreneur Seth Godin lights a fire in this passionate and heartfelt book about social changemaking, teaching readers how to spread powerful ideas in any field. <i>Linchpin </i>will motivate you to use your unique skills and personality to make change—not because you’re an entrepreneur or powerful public speaker, but because your contribution is a building block to meaningful impact.</p>

		<title>How We’re “Counting” on Documentaries: Three Questions for Social Change Filmmakers</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Note from frank: This year, we'll expand our frank gathering with a focus on connecting the community of documentary producers and those who are experimenting with new forms of narrative through virtual reality with our existing frank community of movement builders. We're intrigued by how these new platforms for storytelling can build empathy and drive action. Stay tuned as this idea evolves. We'll keep you posted here at frank talk. </em>

<i>This post originally published on the Media Impact Project blog <a href="http://www.mediaimpactproject.org/the-fray---documentary-film-impact/-how-were-counting-on-documentaries-three-questions-for-social-change-filmmakers">here</a>.</i>

<hr />

[Documentaries] <em>have singled out some of the most vital issues facing Americans today. To these issues they have attempted to bring information, clarification, and</em><em> </em><strong><em>more importantly, a point of view</em></strong><em>…There has been a growing appreciation for the</em><em> </em><strong><em>need for different standards against which to evaluate the performance of the documentaries</em></strong><strong>."</strong> [emphasis mine]

Elmo C. Wilson, The Public Opinion Quarterly

<hr />

As a media strategist, I’ve been talking to social change filmmakers about social change funders (and the other way around) for many years now, but very few issues make all eyebrows go up more than “metrics.” In my unscientific and subjective opinion, these expressions of consternation are getting more pronounced as a pendulum swings once again towards the indicators of change. (The topic can also bring looks of excitement, anticipation, curiosity and incredulity, but that’s another essay.)

It’s time for a more – dare I say– <em>measured </em>conversation among filmmakers, funders, social scientists, artists and advocates about what we mean when we talk about impact.

<strong>“Metrics Mania”?</strong>

Social scientists – with or without participation from creatives– have been hammering out methods and metrics for assessing the contributions of non-fiction storytelling for a long time. Researcher Elmo Wilson, trained as a journalist and quoted above, wrote about “different standards” for documentaries in <strong>1948</strong>. When I commissioned an assessment of <a href="http://howdoweknow.net/start-here/how-we-got-here/"><em>The Heart of the Matter</em> Community Campaign</a>, based on the film by Gini Reticker and Amber Hollibaugh) in 1994, there was already a body of work to build on.

So what’s changed? Amid the 24/7 media deluge, stories that speak to the heart are especially prized. Captivating documentaries – in many forms– are being used today to prompt action on every social issue. New technologies have made it easier to produce, distribute, interact with and gather numbers associated with their influence. That’s one reason why neuroscientists, social entrepreneurs and policy wonks are paying attention as never before. Before we consider whether and which new tools to use, we need to think about what it is that we really want to know. And we can’t assume that the magic of a gut-wrenching, funny and/or searing film can ever be fully “counted.” With that in mind, here are a few ways to delve in.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">1. What’s the Change You Want to See?</strong>

Metrics mean “a system or standard of measurement” and thus, are not for every kind of documentary campaign. (Some of my favorite films are works of pure art and, happily for me, defy any calculation.) <strong>If you’re hoping to contribute to a specific social movement or social change process</strong>, ask yourself: what change do you hope to see in, say, one or two years? Do you want to tell a story that will help people with different kinds of perspectives come together, as a Rake might gather various leaves? Or, with the precision of a sharp Trowel, will you dig into a trenchant problem, followed by a clear call to action or policy reform?
<div class="paragraph"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ellen-image1.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-10180 " src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ellen-image1.png" alt="ellen-image1" width="691" height="195" /></a></div>
<div class="paragraph">

Perhaps you want to transport viewers with a strong character-rich story and only a subtle hint of an underlying social problem? These Wheelbarrows have their own qualities and the method of measurement would look entirely different from that of a Trowel or a Shovel. Although many films are hybrids, identifying the strength of your story can clarify what to measure – and even whether to measure at all. (More about the <a href="http://howdoweknow.net/horticulture-tools/">Horticulture</a> metaphor.) And keep in mind that unexpected outcomes, surprising consequences, and creative uses of your story are just as important as your best laid plans – they’re the emotional fuel that filmmakers bring to social movements.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">2. Where’s the Common Ground?</strong>

Several years ago, a funder who was new to media grantmaking asked me what filmmakers thought about a particular issue. I replied that I would never attempt to speak on their behalf and that they’re a highly diverse community made up of unique motivations, visions and business models. I thought it might be useful to sketch out some general categories (flawed, yes, as you’ll see below); understanding that filmmakers might crossover at certain points in their careers or refer to completely different identities.

</div>
<div class="paragraph"></div>
<div class="paragraph"></div>
<div class="paragraph"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ellen-image2.png"><img class="alignnone  wp-image-10181" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ellen-image2.png" alt="ellen-image2" width="769" height="171" /></a></div>
<div class="paragraph"></div>
<div class="paragraph">

Funders aren’t monolithic either and the comment about filmmaker identities holds for funders as well. This might sound obvious, but keep in mind that the people who make decisions about what to fund are individuals with unique ideas, attitudes about media, experiences and often pressures.

<hr />

"Social-issue filmmakers have deepened foundations’ commitment to funding nonfiction films. We opened up many more funders’ interest in financing documentary films by cultivating foundation personnel to understand how film could be useful <em>when it aligns with the pursuit of the foundations’ mission."</em>

Pamela Yates and Paco de Onis, “Debunking Five Myths That Divide Us” Documentary Magazine Winter 2015

<hr />

Before you meet with prospective funder(s), a) find out what kind of change they are working for, and b) why and whether metrics are important to them. For example, Gates Foundation and Ford Foundation have very different definitions and expectations for “impact.” (Some funders are very public about their position–read what the Fledgling Fund published last summer.) Open up a conversation that seeks common ground -- <em>garden metaphor intended</em>— and alignment of aspirations.

Funders who are interested in documentaries have plenty of sources for data–but if they’re considering film, they’re also looking for the emotional connections that only vivid storytelling can bring. (Maybe they’ll see something in your story that had never occurred to you.)

Some funders have heard that the “impact” money is perceived of as “easier to get” than production funds, so they’ll want to know how serious and accountable you are. The funders I know would rather have a candid conversation about the “meaning of metrics” than hear an outpouring of impact guarantees that have little substance [relevance?] or an unrealistic set of goals. Don’t tell them what you think they want to hear. Tell them what you are aiming for as an <strong>artist and an agent of change</strong>.

<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">3. Who’s Counting?</strong>

As noted above, some funders have evaluation protocols in place that are a condition of accepting a grant. Understanding it in full will help you make good decisions about next steps.

But let’s say that you and your funder—and possibly the advocates or grantees who are eager to work with your film—are developing a way to understand how the project is making a difference. Even if you feel comfortable (or excited, or realistic) about being part of this assessment, it doesn’t mean that you’re the best person to gather and analyze the data. To paraphrase what I heard in a focus group in New York,

“So, in addition to financing, producing, getting releases and permits, apologizing to my family, finding a subject that’s gone missing, correcting the color and negotiating my distribution deals…now I’m a social scientist too?” This filmmaker would be off making her next film by the time any “change” could be detected. But in Los Angeles, another filmmaker said: “It’s my project and I’m the only one who could possibly determine what counts as success. That’s my next step.”We’re developing a tool to help filmmakers weigh their involvement in assessment. <a href="mailto:hdwk@activevoice.net" target="_blank">Sign up</a> and we’ll send you our “Perspectrum” once our creative advisors have weighed in.)

<strong>Reinventing Elmo</strong>

I’ve seen how powerful documentaries can fuel social change and I want others to understand this power better and be able to harness it for good. We have the tools. And now we need to apply them in ways that <strong>enhance our strategies, inspire new allies, engage the creative community, and strengthen the ecosystem striving for meaningful change</strong>. Instead of raising our eyebrows, let’s raise these complex, sometimes awkward issues.  Let’s dig in.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>For our Public Health Week at frank, we're thrilled to share this video from <a href="http://cureviolence.org/">Cure Violence</a>, an organization that adopts a public health approach to stopping violence. Founder and CEO Gary Slutkin launched Cure Violence in 2000 with a mission to reshape our worldview of violence away from prosecution, and instead understanding violence as a disease that can be controlled, treated and prevented. Cure Violence puts this idea into practice using the methods and strategies associated with epidemic control -- detecting and interrupting conflicts, identifying and treating the highest risk individuals, and changing social norms. </em>

<em>This video animation is the latest communications tool developed in partnership with Without Violence to break down this complex idea and encourage new thinking around this public health approach to violence. - frank team</em>

<hr />

<em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://cureviolence.org/post/violence-is-contagious-be-part-of-the-cure/">CureViolence.org</a>.</em>

Cure Violence was one of a dozen global NGOs chosen to participate in a year-long fellowship sponsored by <em><strong>Without Violence</strong></em> to build and train violence prevention leaders to communicate effectively to attain social impact and change behavior and policy. Without Violence and Cure Violence staff worked to develop a national and global public policy campaign focused on a health approach to violence prevention. Kudos to <em><strong>Without Violence</strong></em> for their hard work in producing this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPEK1mpCAgA">new video</a> to explain the health approach.

<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
&nbsp;

<em><strong>Without Violenc</strong><strong>e</strong></em> is a new field-building pilot project designed to help violence prevention leaders and practitioners communicate solutions and accelerate their impact on improving the lives of boys and girls.  The<em> “Voices from the Field”</em> Fellowship Program uses the findings from a “Solutions Taxonomy” to build the communications and advocacy capacity of leaders working to prevent violence against children, inspiring deeper and more sustained engagement on the issue.  The program is simultaneously testing the applicability of the findings in different social and cultural contexts.

The Voices from the Field Fellowship cohort for 2014 included practitioners and youth advocates already working to prevent violence in the lives of children.  They collectively address multiple forms of violence against children including harsh physical punishment, exposure to intimate partner violence, sexual violence and exploitation, violence in schools and gang violence. The cohort was selected based on their commitment, involvement in successful efforts to reduce violence against children and their ability to drive transformative change in their institutions and political contexts.

The 2014 Fellowship cohort included Cure Violence (U.S., South America, Middle East), Raising Voices (Uganda), Center for Domestic Violence Prevention (Uganda), UNICEF (Global), Eurochild (Europe), Save the Children (Global), Child Protection Working Group (Global), Daniel CIYOTA(Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo), INFANT (Peru), International Rescue Committee (Global) and Know Violence (Global).]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Marriage equality has finally arrived, and while turning our Facebook profile photos into rainbows of pride is a great way to signal our support for LGBT rights, it’s really just a first step.

There’s much more work to be done to achieve full equality for members of the LGBT community who continue to experience discrimination in<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/06/18/2175541/landmark-hud-anti-gay-housing-discrimination/"> housing</a> and<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2011/06/02/9872/gay-and-transgender-people-face-high-rates-of-workplace-discrimination-and-harassment/"> employment</a> every day and are at a<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/lgbthealth/youth.htm"> higher risk of violence and suicide</a> than other Americans.

Recognizing the<a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/news/2015/06/29/116143/infographic-the-discrimination-that-remains-beyond-marriage/"> ongoing need</a> for change, we at frank are eager to share the following insight and resources for social change communicators who want to lend their voices to the cause.
&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><b>Start with a Story.</b> An engaging personal story can increase understanding, empathy and interest in an issue by humanizing it. User-generated storytelling can also help drive engagement around a social media campaign. For example,</li>

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I won’t beat around the bush here. There’s $10,000 at stake.

That’s the grand prize for The University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015-prize-in-public-interest-communications-research/">annual prize in public interest communications</a> research. This week, researchers are invited to begin submitting their peer-reviewed work.

The prize is in its third year celebrating leading research that informs the growing discipline and practice of public interest communications. Meaning, research that builds movements, contributes to the betterment of society at large and <i>moves </i>the needle.

Last year, we learned from <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015-prize-submissions/">winner Sara N Bleich, PhD</a>, how communicating easy-to-understand caloric information on sugary sodas may help consumers make healthier decisions. And in 2014, <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2014-prize-winners/">Jina Yoo shared</a> ways in which our emotions conveyed in communications can have varying impact on our decision-making process, especially when it comes to our health.

Learning from this kind of research is what makes public interest communicators in the <i>frank </i>community do our jobs better. But, what’s in it for you, the researcher? Here are three reasons why you should consider submitting your peer-reviewed research to the 2016 Prize in Public Interest Communications.
<ol>
	<li><b>Did I mention the $10,000 prize? </b>The grand prize winner will walk away with $10,000, and two other runners-up will win $1,500 each.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li><b>Present your research to people who will actually use it.</b> The <i>frank</i> gathering, where prize finalists will present their work, is the foremost conference for social change communicators. Here, experts and key decision-makers around the country gather to network with the <i>frank</i> community and glean inspiration for real programmatic changes within their organizations. If there is one community who can use your research to advance change, it’s this one.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">To set you up for success, <i>frank</i> conference organizers provide a free workshop on communicating research to prize winners. This workshop will include a one-on-one session with a pro to prepare for individual frank talks.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><b>Get media attention. </b>Landing a $10,000 prize for your research will generate fresh attention to your research that can bring media knocking. Prior to her win, Sara Bleich earned stellar <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/16/356437295/should-menus-list-miles-to-walk-to-burn-off-your-meal-or-soda">NPR coverage</a> for her research, and has since been effective at resurfacing the research, tying it into relevant current events and being a resource for news reporters. 2015 runner-up Brendan Nyhan also leveraged the ongoing focus on his research to land media attention in <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2015/06/30/3675354/liberals-pitched-near-perfect-game-supreme-court-term/">ThinkProgress</a> and <a href="http://www.cjr.org/analysis/california_vaccines_protest.php">Columbia Journalism Review</a>, illustrating his expertise in the field.</li>
</ol>
Get the full submission guidelines <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015-prize-in-public-interest-communications-research/">here</a>. We’d love to hear which public interest research has piqued your interest lately. Share in the comments below.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Three Ways to Inspire Your Audience to Act</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/07/three-ways-to-inspire-your-audience-to-act/</link>
		<pubDate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 21:49:46 +0000</pubDate>
		<dc:creator><![CDATA[Mark Dessauer]]></dc:creator>
		<guid isPermaLink="false">http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/?p=10558</guid>
		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>When Mark Dessauer, Director of Communications at <a href="http://www.bcbsncfoundation.org/">Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina</a> <a href="http://www.bcbsncfoundation.org/">Foundation</a>, attended the annual frank gathering for social change communicators in Gainesville, Fla. this past February, the discussion around how to motivate people to take action made an impression.</em>

<em>Here, in his words, are three effective ways to communicate with your audiences so they are motivated to take concrete steps to help advance your cause. -- frank team</em>

<hr />

How do we shape our communications to engage audiences TO ACT for change?
<ul>
	<li><b>Humor: </b>The most reliable way to folks’ hearts and minds is through laughter. Satire has played a critical role in bringing Millennials into the news via the <i>The Daily Show</i>, <i>The Colbert Report</i> and similar programs. If you want to make an impact, you have to change how people think. Engaging critical thinking via satire (and humor) is an effective way to start.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Hope:</b> Brains work on stories, and humorous stories activate altruism and hopefulness. If you shout awful news to people, they will give up. Take the environmental movement: We need a new narrative focused on us people, rather than the planet—one about hope and a future that doesn’t suck, with reasons to hope and fight for.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><b>Relevance: </b>Relevance rules, and is the only path to empathy. Believe it or not, effective change is being motivated by Hollywood. If you’ve seen any of these films from <a href="http://www.participantmedia.com/">Participant Media</a>—<i>The Cove</i>, <i>Contagion</i>, <i>The Help</i>, <i>Food Inc.</i> and <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i>—you see what I mean. The Participant Media team believes a story well told can change the world. To measure that it’s “well told” they use a narrative involvement scale to measure the impact of their movies. Their findings highlight two “must do’s”:</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">1) Generate empathy in your audience members</p>
<p style="padding-left: 50px;">2) Highlight issues and wants that are relevant to their daily lives, which is the only path to creating empathy. Otherwise, your communications are a wasted “who cares.”</p>
&nbsp;

The better your communications do on these fronts, the more likely your audience is to act. I wouldn’t waste a moment!

&nbsp;

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b></b><em>We can’t believe its been one year since we launched <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/">frankology</a>, where we cover the latest peer-reviewed research that can help do gooders do better. We started frankology with some scratch paper and a challenge: connect public interest communicators with research that can help them do their jobs better.</em>

<em>When we first started, we faced the grand task of harnessing the vast knowledge of our team of academics and training them in the art of understandable writing. While we are still learning and growing, 365 days later we are now sharing the latest research from fields like political science, social psychology, public relations, communications, public health, sociology, and more! frankology features award-winning research from the <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015-prize-in-public-interest-communications-research/">annual prize in public interest communications</a> research, and other hand-curated research that’s most relevant to change agents like you.</em>

<em>We can’t wait to start our second year, and continue to build our frankology team and scope (hint hint).</em>

Take a look back at our favorite studies from the year.
<ol>
	<li><strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/use-the-right-emotion-for-the-right-ask/">Use the Right Emotion for the Right Ask</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Public interest communicators know that evoking emotion is a surefire way to engage audiences and move them to action. But which emotions are most effective, and which ones are pushing your audience away? 2014 frank research prize winners Jina H. Yoo, Matthew W. Kreuter, Choi Lai, and Qiang Fu share findings that can inform public interest campaigns.</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-messenger-is-the-message/">The Messenger is the Message</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Who are the trusted sources of information? Scientists? Elected officials? Or, your friend or family member? Winners of a <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015-prize-submissions/">$1,500 frank prize</a>, David Sleeth-Keppler, Robert Perkowitz and Meighen Speiser reveal when public interests communicators should rely on “formal” communicators or “informal” communicators when reaching—and persuading—target audiences.</p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/its-ok-to-get-all-touchy-feely-about-female-condoms/">It's Ok to Get All Touchy, Feely About Female Condoms</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Despite being an effective contraception tool, female condoms get a bad rap. Rather, they don’t get discussed at all. Researchers Charla Markham Shaw and Karishma Chatterjee interviewed male and female participants to understand current perceptions about female condoms—a launchpad for sexual health care providers to tweak messaging and give informed recommendations about female condoms that actually resonate with patients.</p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-pyramid-approach-how-twitter-use-is-shaping-up-among-advocacy-groups/">The Pyramid Approach: How Twitter Use is Shaping Up Among Advocacy Groups</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A “pyramid” approach is gaining traction among advocacy organizations in order to not only engage audiences, but turn them into loyal supporters. Researchers find that effective Twitter communications requires three steps: reach out, deepen knowledge and sustain interest and then motivate to action.</p>

<ol start="5">
	<li><strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-truth-about-why-some-people-believe-fiction-over-facts/">The Truth About Why Some People Believe Fiction Over Facts</a></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Beliefs trump facts, and what does it take to get stubborn, set-in-her-ways believer to change her mind? This study’s researchers designed a series of experiments to measure how people process and understand new information. What they found were a few secret weapons that communicators can use to share facts and sway opinions—or at least get audiences thinking about an issue in a different way.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>"When someone makes you laugh there is connection, you can’t deny it.” - Lizz Winstead, co-creator and former head writer of The Daily Show. <i>frank</i> 2014</blockquote>
Today we are all in mourning as our favorite satirist, Jon Stewart, steps down from his 16-year run at <i>The Daily Show</i>. Many of us spent the last decade or so laughing and cheering when he perfectly articulated all the emotions we were feeling.

<span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1438869150937_11045">Stewart will go down in history as one of the most influential television personalities for many reasons, including for how he </span><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1438869150937_11051">used comedy to inspire a new generation of people to engage in politics and ask critical questions.</span>

For those of us who work in public interest communications, Stewart leaves behind lots of lessons.  Namely, Stewart showed us that engaging storytelling is an effective way to reach your audience. Stewart was the master of storytelling, using narrative to speak to our heart, data to speak to our head, and humor to speak to our gut.

As a goodbye tribute, we looked into the <i>frank</i> archives to see what other people have to say about how hitting the funny bone of your audience can be useful for creating social change.

Researchers find that campaigns that use humor to encourage young men to check themselves regularly for testicular cancer can be effective. One campaign, Check Yo Nutz, used a number of mediums for sharing their message about self-checking for testicular cancer, increasing young men’s knowledge of testicular cancer and how to perform self-exams above pre-campaign levels.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Communicators use emotions to reach, connect and engage with their audiences. When it comes to storytelling and messaging for social change, fear, humor and sadness can be especially effective if used properly.

Researchers from multiple disciplines are looking at the effectiveness of certain emotions in reaching and motivating audiences to take action. Over the last year we've compiled a variety of studies for<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/"> frankology</a> that show different ways emotions can be used to support change efforts. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Check out these 6 </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">findings on ways</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> to use emotion in your work.</span>

&nbsp;

1) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-to-boo-st-action-on-climate-change/">Anguish</a> can be a good thing for a campaign, especially when people know they can take effective action on the problem.

A new study suggests that to get people to take action on climate change, frightening them a little can be a good thing. But to succeed, you also have to show people how they can fight back.

2) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/some-ghoulish-findings-about-fear-of-death-and-charitable-giving/">Fear</a> of dying can make us more generous.

New research suggests that reminding people of their mortality makes them more generous.

3) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/use-the-right-emotion-for-the-right-ask/">Sadness </a>can speak to the heart of your audience and motivate them to take action.

When it comes to encouraging people to get screened for cancer, research suggests that getting your audience to shed a few tears may be a good thing.

4) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-tree-huggers-got-it-right-the-link-between-compassion-and-conservation/">Compassion</a> has some real benefits in getting people to think about their impact on the world.

New research brings some good news for environmental advocates: Boosting your audience’s compassion levels may increase their environmentalist tendencies.

5) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-power-of-awe-in-increasing-generosity/">Awe</a>, the feelings of wonder, can make people kinder.

New research suggests that increasing pro-social behaviors like generosity may be as simple as reminding people that they are part of something larger than themselves.

6) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/when-it-comes-to-vaccines-a-story-is-worth-a-thousand-statistics/">Worry</a> leads many parents to consider alternatives to vaccinations.

According to researchers, negative stories that evoke worry have a greater impact on parents’ perceptions of vaccine safety than do statistics.

		<title>And…ACTION: Saving the World One Guilty Pleasure at a Time</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> poster hangs prominently on my office wall. As I am ostensibly an adult, I tell people I keep it there because the tagline is an example of perfect messaging: “Pert. Wholesome. Way Lethal.” But the truth is, I like the entire concept of Buffy. I am a <i>fan.</i>

When the TV series debuted in 1997, I watched every episode as it aired. And remember: this was before DVD and On Demand. While I was trying to make my way as a woman in male-dominated Washington, D.C., Buffy was kicking ass and taking names. For seven seasons, I relished having her as a role model – even if I did view this weekly indulgence as a guilty pleasure.

Flash forward to 2014 and my start in the Aspen Institute’s Henry Crown Fellowship Program. This two-year opportunity challenges leaders to think beyond their current roles and find ways to create significant change in the world. As a fellow, I had to develop a project that would stretch my leadership skills. Since I run advocacy campaigns for a living, anything that looked remotely like a campaign was off the table. Instead, I had to come up with something that could create an impact – but was entirely new to me. It was like telling Buffy to dust a vampire without using a wooden stake. I was stymied.

Then last fall as I watched <i>How to Get Away with Murder </i>while trying to think up a project that would save the world and satisfy the Aspen Institute’s criteria, the socially and politically tinged dialogue of the program caught my attention. I began to wonder if there was a way to make it easy for cause organizations to harness the power of film and television storylines to push their issues.

And suddenly, it hit me. Buffy wasn’t a guilty pleasure – she was the solution.

I would use stories for social good. But I wouldn’t try to change what was on TV or coming to theaters. There are already great groups doing that. Rather, I would take stories already scripted, taped and produced, and help groups find creative ways to use them. Before the discovery shot of <i>Murder </i>flashed on my television screen, my project came into focus.

I would connect groups working on civil rights and race relations to relevant story arcs coming up on <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/entertainment/television/TV-Ferguson-primetime-Scandal-race.html"><i>Scandal</i></a> and <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/01/the-good-wife-stumbles-trying-to-confront-institutional-racism/384448/"><i>The Good Wife</i>.</a> I’d make sure groups working to stop sexual abuse on school campuses knew that the second season of <a href="http://deadline.com/2015/08/trevor-jackson-american-crime-jenna-dewan-tatum-supergirl-1201491174/"><i> American Crime, set to air in early 2016,</i> will feature a central plot line around this issue</a> and offer them tips for how to use the show to drive chatter among their networks – and reach new audiences. I’d encourage nonprofits tackling climate change or addressing homelessness to check out the upcoming film <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stefanie-penn-spear/world-premiere-of-chloe-theos-and-its-extraordinary-story_b_7086902.html"><i>Chloe and Theo</i></a> and I’d give other organizations ideas for using Mark Wahlberg’s upcoming movie <a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/04/the-movie-bp-probably-doesnt-want-you-to-see/"><i>Deepwater Horizon</i></a> to take aim at the fossil fuel industry.

Why would advocacy groups working on critical issues devote time to popular television programs and movies? Simple. They need good stories. Though nonprofits are making great strides in building their own storytelling skills, the head writer for the Emmy-nominated <i>Empire </i>still has most of them beat. Organizations need to be able to tell their own stories – but they can also tap into the state-of-the-art storytelling television and movies have to offer, while connecting with new audiences on a very personal level.

Enter <a href="http://and-action.org/">And…ACTION</a>, a new way to connect cause organizations to upcoming film and TV storylines that are relevant to their work – and give them the lead-time needed to prepare online features, social media or other events that use the stories to engage viewers on their issues. TV and film creators are masters at getting people to feel something, and when people have feelings, they act.  Even better, the television and film industry tells hundreds of new stories every day – and most of them are free. And best of all, And…ACTION is poised to break down the barriers that currently keep groups from taking advantage of this resource.

<i>1) Groups don’t know where the opportunities are.</i> And…ACTION will help groups be opportunity omniscient. Users can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/andactionnow">@andactionnow</a> and (once it’s up and running) visit the website to find out what upcoming TV and film storylines could offer opportunities to drive their issues.

2) <i>Even when advocacy groups are aware of upcoming storylines, they don’t know how to use them to support their work. </i>And…ACTION will feature lessons learned from organizations that used movies like <i>The Help</i> to improve the lives of domestic workers or <i>Law and Order SVU</i> to address the issue of the rape kit backlog. Sharing behind-the-scenes examples of how groups have leveraged these opportunities will spur creativity among other organizations and encourage experimentation with this genre.  Additionally, the website will feature a toolkit with tips for using storylines in different ways – and the encouragement groups need to try it themselves.

3) <i>This is new territory. Organizations are wary of how to tap into this resource in a savvy, media-literate way. </i>If a storyline is inaccurate or negative, can organizations still use it?  Of course. For example, police dramas sometimes involve a detective strong-arming an immigrant with questionable status into telling what he knows. This, of course, is a false stereotype – immigrants are statistically much less likely to be involved in crimes. And…ACTION will offer counsel on sophisticated ways groups can use these scenes to start a conversation that ultimately gets viewers to question myths, misperceptions and stereotypes.

And…ACTION is a big experiment. When it comes to stretching my skills in a new direction – a focus of this fellowship project – I can definitely check that box as I find ways to bring together cause organizations and the entertainment field. But there’s something else good here. This project has the potential to bring social change to life for many more people in a variety of compelling ways. We are just in our pilot phase, but have already hired a project <a href="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/team/chris-dzialo/">director</a>, launched our social media and started pulling storylines set to air during the fall premiers.

To receive our latest updates, <a href="https://twitter.com/andactionnow">follow And…ACTION on Twitter</a> and send an email to <a href="mailto:andaction@spitfirestrategies.com">andaction@spitfirestrategies.com</a> to get on our mailing list.

		<title>How To Win Faster: Learning from the women&#039;s movement 95 years later</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[August marks the 95th anniversary of women winning the right to vote in the United States. As great a watershed moment as that was, it took years for women to win the same rights as men. One glaring example: it wasn’t until 1967—some 56 years later-- that women could serve on juries in all 50 states.

While some states allowed women to sit on juries as early as 1911, and some awarded the right along with the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920, most states restricted jury seats to men well into the mid- century.

Why did some factions of the movement win faster? The answer to that question—“strategic adaption” –holds valuable lessons for today’s change-makers and movement builders.

<a href="http://as.vanderbilt.edu/sociology/bio/holly-mccammon">Dr. Holly McCammon </a>of Vanderbuilt University has spent her career studying why some factions of the jury movement won faster than others.

McCammon defines strategic adaption as a “set of critical steps in which activists adapt their tactics and discourses to developments in the broader political and cultural environment.”

According to McCammon, in the early 20th century, jury activists--made up of the league of women voter organizations, business and professional women’s clubs, and branches of the national woman’s party--engaged in strategic campaigns. Their campaigns included lobbying state lawmakers, organizing mass letter-writing campaigns, staging protests, holding rallies, and using the local media to bring about favorable public opinion and mobilize support for jury bills.

McCammon says the strategic adaption model typically involves four critical steps:

First, McCammon says that fundamental to the various state level movement’s success was “having a finger on the pulse of the contentious arena.” That is being <i>alert</i> to signals from movement opponents, various publics, allies, potential allies, and the general culture itself.

Signals, particularly those that provide insight on the movement’s setbacks and failures, provide clear direction as to the next steps to succeed.

For example, McCammon discusses the strategic response of jury activists in California in 1915 following a loss in the state legislature.

“In 1915, the jury rights movement was stymied in its first attempt to gain passage of a new jury law. Gail Laughlin, representing the San Francisco Center of the California Civic League. . . argued before the legislature that 75,000 women of the state wanted the right to sit on juries. The California Senate in the end voted the bill down, and Laughlin and her colleagues worked to make sense of the defeat. They quickly realized that various lawmakers sent clear signals explaining their unwillingness to support a change in jury law. For instances, Senator W.E. Duncan wrote Julia George, another movement activist, that he questioned the accuracy of claiming 75,000 women want to sit on juries…. Jury activists turned these lawmakers’ signals about why legislators did not support jury rights into lessons about how the women should alter their strategy and tactics to win. . . Over the next two years California activists implemented an adaptive strategy. (They) worked on a vigorous educational campaign …to educate the public on the issue. The strategic analysis and adaption paid off. Opposition inside and outside the legislature waned, and during the 1917 legislative session, women in California gained the right to sit on juries as lawmakers were finally persuaded that women did indeed want to sit on juries.”

Second, following signals, activists <i>assess and analyze</i> their own actions. During this stage, the movement engages in self-reflection and self-evaluation of tactics, and consider ways to strategically respond to signals.

For example, activist groups responded strategically and quickly to oppositions by focusing on increasing their political support

Jury activists in Illinois actively sought endorsements from judges “who were willing to speak out publicly in favor of women on juries… legislators had repeatedly told activists that they opposed jury rights for women because of their belief that women did not want such rights. Speeches and letters by political elites were an attempt to persuade lawmakers to support the jury bill by offering alternative arguments.” This was a calculated move to shift the conversation away from whether women even wanted to sit on juries, and onto highlighting the growing political support for the bill.

Third, successful movements <i>adjust</i> their strategy based on critical signals and self evaluation. Successful groups are flexible and adapt, and create new tactics that, based off of their evaluation, are most likely to succeed.

McCammon notes that “the most successful tactics are those tailored to the signals sent from the contentious arena about what is needed to succeed.”

For example, activist groups used different framing strategies to reach the head and the heart of lawmakers and the general public. One framing strategy that was particularly effective was the use of wartime framing. In states like Missouri, Nebraska and Vermont, bills that allowed women to sit on juries were passed during World War 2. McCammon attributes these successes to activists framing that used the war as a rationale for jury rights.

In 1942, to persuade Vermont voters, one activists argued “equality and justice under the Stars and Stripes is the principle for which we are waging this war… This election day gives the voters here at home an opportunity to express themselves… in order that our talk of equal rights and freedom may not be simply an empty boast.” In this case, Vermont activists used the war as an opportunity to strategically connect to the values and beliefs of the American people.

Lastly, movement actors and groups must continuously <i>follow through</i> on their changed tactics.

McCammon found that in faster states, activist actively engaged more continuously, than those in slower states. For example, “California, Illinois and Wisconsin had nonstop organizational engagement. New York’s women worked on jury campaigns 95% of the time and Tennessee’s women devoted their efforts in 89% of the years. These five states, all of which responded strategically to defeats and opposition, had the highest levels of organizational engagement.”

McCammon’s strategic adaption model, based on empirical examination of the jury rights movement, provides us with insight for how to win faster:

Keep your finger on the pulse of the contentious arena, respond strategically to signals, adapt strategies to cultural events and tap into values and beliefs strategically, and lastly, never stop pushing and trying new things to move your movement forward to win.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Part Of The Argument:  LGBTQ Storytelling and Social Change</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“You think you can change America through film?” – <strong>Charlie Rose</strong></i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>“Oh, I don’t know. That’s not even in my job description. Storytelling. Get the story right. Do what you can with the story. Try not to cheat the story. Whatever happens after that is in the purview of other people. I felt that way as a reporter; I feel that way doing this. But every now and then you get to be a part of an argument, and that feels good.” – <strong>David Simon</strong></i></p>
Despite desperate efforts to create the next “viral” video or to fund a social impact film that turns the policy agenda on its head, the contribution of storytelling to social change is cumulative–and it takes time.

A single story can evoke passion, promote empathy, teach, enrage, or empower its audience to take action–but it alone will not change the world. But every now and then you get to be part of an argument, and that feels good.

One TYPE of story can’t change the world either; we cannot live on didactic social issue films alone. Pop culture–even the really bad stuff–contributes, as do the personal stories we tell each other (online and IRL) or that we hear on the news. Art and music inspire us to see the world differently, or to be willing to do so.

Even a simple photograph can make a difference. The image of Michael Brown’s father <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2014/08/25/article-2733579-20CAE11500000578-315_634x424.jpg">yelling in pain</a> at his son’s funeral, sweat soaking the front of his shirt, must have led even some of the most callous among us to realize something must be done to stop the war on young black men in this country.

<a href="http://www.whatisaggregate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/article-2733579-20CAE11500000578-315_634x424.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2502 size-full aligncenter" src="http://www.whatisaggregate.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/article-2733579-20CAE11500000578-315_634x424.jpg" alt="article-2733579-20CAE11500000578-315_634x424" width="634" height="424" /></a>

Over the past few years, the acceleration in the movement to ensure the civil rights of the LGBTQ community has been remarkable–even dizzying at times. While in the past decade there has been a sense that progress—particularly marriage equality—would come simply through the passage of time and a change in generational leadership, many of us still presumed the “inevitable” was years down the road.

Without a doubt, this progress can be attributed to a whole bunch of activists across this country, busting their asses and using their smarts to change the minds of policymakers and judges. But storytelling has been an accelerant to the pace of change, including the personal “coming out” stories so many have had the courage to tell at the risk of rejection, discrimination, and even violence.

In a 2013 <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/06/13/a-survey-of-lgbt-americans/">Pew survey</a> of LGBT Americans, 70 percent expressed their belief that “knowing someone who is LGBT helps a lot in terms of making society more accepting of the LGBT population.” When President Obama sat down with Robin Roberts <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-robin-roberts-abc-news-interview-president-obama/story?id=16316043">on ABC News</a> in 2012, becoming the first sitting U.S. President publicly to voice his support for marriage equality, he shared that dinner table conversations with his daughters Sasha and Malia about their friends’ same sex parents were what contributed to his changing views.

It is more difficult to hate when the object of your hostility is your child, your colleague, your neighbor, your teacher or, it seems, the parents of your children’s friends.

We created a timeline, <i><a href="http://whatisaggregate.com/lgbtq">LGBTQ Storytelling and Social Change</a></i>, out of our own curiosity. We knew that storytelling – personal and pop culture – had played a role in progress in the LGBTQ rights movement, but we wanted to map the progression and to see the relationship over time of storytelling, social milestones and policy change. From Henry Gerber to Jennicet Gutierrez, from <i>The Ladder</i> to <i>How to Survive a Plague, </i>from President Eisenhower’s policy to ban “homosexuals” from working for the federal government to the U.S. Senate’s repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell, we’ve done that.

It is a timeline that reveals small steps and giant leaps forward as well as frequent and devastating falls backward. It is, oddly, a testament to both impatience (with injustice) and patience (with the long haul). It reflects that, even as gay characters became more prominent in films and television, gay people of color did not. It reflects the actions of presidents and other policy makers, bigots, activists, writers, actors, filmmakers, designers, magazine editors, murderers, artists, reality show stars, judges, musicians, athletes, and Dear Abby.

The triumphs remind us of how much has been done to get us to where we are and of the people who carried the burden, both the names in bold and those who will never be adequately acknowledged. They also remind us of how much more work still needs to be done.

We can celebrate love, but we can’t allow a wedding veil to block our view of the discriminatory practices that prevent many gay and transgender people–particularly people of color–from getting or keeping jobs or finding a home.

We can smile at a photo of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stuart-symington/we-stand-proud-with-presi_b_7674368.html">Laverne Cox with the President and First Lady</a>, but we shouldn’t forget to weep in response to the transgender women who have been murdered in the United States since the beginning of 2015: Lamia Beard, Ty Underwood, Papi Edwards, Bri Golec, Yazmin Vash Payne, Taja Gabrielle DeJesus, Penny Proud, Kristina Gomez Reinwald, London Chanel, Mercedes Williamson, India Clarke, K.C. Haggard, Amber Monroe, Shade Schuler, Ashton O’Hara, Kandis Capri, Elisha Walker, and Tamara Dominiguez.

The process of putting the timeline together made it clear how much we have (and want) to learn. We’re confident that, despite our efforts, we’ve left things out that should be included. If you think there’s a story we should add to our timeline, let us know. Email me at alison AT whatisaggregate DOT com.<b> </b>Tell us a story.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last year at the University of Maryland, I landed an internship with the National Endowment for the Arts. Wow, was I pumped. I was a trained dancer, attended an arts high school and had grown up in the Academy of Music. I was thrilled to have an opportunity to combine my love for the arts with my new communications savvy. I went out and bought an attaché case.

And what an internship it was.

My responsibilities included answering the press line, which actually meant answering calls from random angry taxpayers incensed by the NEA’s most recent funding debacle. (The public affairs manager suggested I put them on hold until they hung up.) I also edited the NEA’s outreach materials, which meant that it was my job to put white stickers over inaccurate content that had made it into a brochure that had already been printed by the thousands.

One night I stayed late because there was a big event coming up the next day, and they needed me to put stickers on a thousand brochures. The task wasn’t done until 7 that night, and one of the staff members offered me a lift home.

We were waiting at a light, and it was quiet. “Ginny,” I asked, “How did you know you wanted to work here? Do you have a background in the arts?”

“Oh, God,” she laughed. “That’s hilarious. People think that just because we work for the NEA, we like LOVE the arts or something. This is just a job.”

Wow.

In that moment, I knew I never wanted to be like her — that for me, nothing would be just a job.

You have had your own moment like this.

Next year at <i>frank</i>, we’ll celebrate <i>that moment</i>. You know the one: That moment you became so outraged you had to take action. That moment you saw the way forward. That moment you decided to speak up for someone else. That moment you believed you could make a difference. That moment you realized that you were unfit for other work. That moment you won.

We’ll celebrate the moments that define us as change-makers, and create dozens of new ones.

If you’ve been to <i>frank</i> before, there are moments that stay with you. Moments at which you realized that there’s a community of people like you. Moments when you found new partners. When you saw a tired challenge with fresh eyes.

Over the course of this week, we’ll be tweeting about the moments that defined us as change makers, and our favorite <i>frank </i>moments.

We invite you to share yours: #thatmoment.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>5 Ways to Bridge the Divide Between Religion and Science</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week Pope Francis will make an historic address to Congress, and no doubt, his words will be carefully listened to, commented on and perhaps move people to action. Among his many talents, the Pope is a powerful communicator about social issues.

At frank, we’re hoping the Pope uses his speech to encourage both policymakers and the American public to do more to address climate change, an issue he previously addressed in this summer’s groundbreaking encyclical.

If nothing else, much could be accomplished if his words simply get people to acknowledge that climate change is caused by human activities. Admittedly, though, combating climate science deniers is no easy task. Once misinformation takes root, especially on science topics, it’s hard to change people’s minds.

So, we thought this would be a good opportunity to round up some of our best posts that answer questions such as  “why do people deny scientific evidence” to “how do you turn skeptics into believers?”

<b>Why do people believe misinformation about climate change?</b>

A lot of it has to do with ideology. <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-truth-about-why-some-people-believe-fiction-over-facts/">A study </a>by scholars Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler showed that ideological biases often prevent people from accepting facts that go against their beliefs.

<b>Who are these climate deniers, anyway? What do we know about them?</b>

This probably won’t shock you if you follow the news, but climate change deniers tend to be conservative white men. <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-truth-about-why-some-people-believe-fiction-over-facts/">A study</a> by researchers Aaron M. McCright and Riley E. Dunlap found that this demographic group is much less likely to accept the science on climate change than other American adults.

<b>Are faith and science always in conflict? Do most people prefer one over the other? </b>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/where-does-your-compass-point-science-or-religion/">A study</a> done by Timothy O’Brien and Shiri Noy found that, in general, people do tend to be either scientifically or religiously inclined in terms of their worldview (though there is a small group that favors both). These worldviews can have a big impact on how people feel about social issues as well as the environment.

<b>So how can we message to these skeptical groups? Is there a way to get through to them on climate change?</b>

There is some good news, though. <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-messenger-is-the-message/">A study</a> done by David Sleeth-Keppler, Robert Perkowitz, and Meighen Speiser found that, for people who are suspicious of “formal” science communicators like scientists and government workers, it’s possible to get the message out by tapping into informal networks like neighborhoods, families, and religious groups.

<b>Alright, so we’ve got people’s attention. Now what? What’s compassion got to do with it?</b>

So you’ve tapped your informal networks. What’s the next step? How do you get people involved? <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-tree-huggers-got-it-right-the-link-between-compassion-and-conservation/">New research</a> suggests that boosting people’s levels of compassion can actually increase their environmentalist tendencies, encouraging them to donate to environmental groups and become more active in conservation.

People of faith and conservationists may not always see eye to eye, but the Pope’s message on climate change shows that we can certainly work together on some of the big things. Check out frank talk on Thursday for a more in-depth analysis of the relationship between conservation and religion!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Building Stronger Relationships Between Environmentalists And Faith Communities</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/09/building-a-stronger-relationships-between-environmentalists-and-faith-communities/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, Pope Francis headed to the White House as part of his historic first tour to the United States. There, he gave a stirring address urging Americans to act on climate change, declaring that <a href="http://www.npr.org/2015/09/23/442907000/pope-francis-highlights-climate-change-at-white-house">“Climate change is a problem which can no longer be left to a future generation.”</a>

Although many observers have described Francis’ groundbreaking encyclical on climate change as a watershed moment, religious groups and environmentalists have a long history of cooperation and collective advocacy. Today, interfaith groups like <a href="http://fastfortheclimate.org/en/">Fast for the Climate </a>and <a href="http://ourvoices.net/index.html">OurVoices</a> are taking on climate change.

Still, it’s worth considering what steps environmentalists can take to build stronger relationships with faith communities. In a 2015 article, published in the journal Coastal Management, Elizabeth McLeon of The Nature Conservancy and Martin Palmer from the Alliance of Religions and Conservation share some suggestions for environmental groups looking to reach out to people of faith.

First, it’s useful for environmental groups to build on existing projects with faith-based organizations. These projects have often already established ties with the faith communities and can offer a bridge for increasing involvement, as well as the experience needed to successfully navigate partnerships between faith and conservation. Groups such as the World Wildlife Foundation’s Sacred Gifts Initiative and the Sierra Club’s Faith Partnerships program are great templates for this kind of work.

Second, McLeon and Palmer stress the need for creating a dialogue to increase cooperation between faith groups and conservationists. Although these groups may have several natural areas of overlap, it’s always useful to continue build trust and understanding between communities.

Stories, specifically, are useful in this process. “Stories can be instrumental in making or changing behavior,” McLeon and Palmer explain. Tapping into the conservation stories of different faiths is a wonderful way to build support for conservation projects. “Acknowledging the sacredness of the natural world,” note McLeon and Palmer, “provides a powerful reason to inspire the masses to protect it.”

Third, conservation groups can benefit from having a holistic vision for their projects that not only protects the natural world but also addresses social problems such as poverty. Some faith groups have argued that there is a conflict between preserving the environment and caring for people, arguing that natural resources have been place on earth for the benefit of people and should be used to benefit the poor rather than conserved. Recognizing that this is a false choice is key to a good partnership.

“Creation care recognizes that human interactions with the natural world result in both environmental and humanitarian consequences,” point out McLeon and Palmer. By taking a holistic approach to conservation that also helps the neediest in society, environmental-faith partnerships can make sure that the needs of both people and the environment are respected and nurtured.

Fourth, McLeon and Palmer remind environmentalists that working with faith groups means acknowledging the differences between – and within – faiths. “A common mistake made by environmental NGOs attempting to develop faith-based conservation programs is to create a post for a single individual who is known to have a faith and then place upon him/her the responsibility to engage all religions and serve as the liaison between religious groups and the environmental organization,” they explain.

This doesn’t work well because a single person does not necessarily represent the beliefs of all the people in his/her faith, nor does it mean that he/she can work well with people of other faiths. Instead, McLeon and Palmer recommend doing outreach to religious groups at different levels, from the local to the national, and working with these members to define shared goals.

Collaboration between environmentalists and faith groups is all about trust and a shared vision. As McLeon and Palmer note, “[P]artnerships between a specific environmental group with a clear issue to address and a faith group with a clear vision of what it believes can be most effective if the conservation group is willing to learn from the faith group about respectful and meaningful ways to engage, to invest resources (financial and otherwise) into developing the environmental leadership capacity of the religious community on these issues, and to share the benefits related to the shared activities with the partnering faith communities.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>When your goal is to change the way that people think and behave, it’s important to really understand what motivates them.</blockquote>
What separates a run-of-the-mill communications campaign from one that has the power to motivate people to take action? Well, lots of things. But one critical element is research, which can make a good campaign great and show you exactly where to aim your campaign and fire.

For good research, you have to ask the right questions, and based on our years of experience, here are a few things we've learned:

<strong>The Basics: </strong>

When you first conceive a campaign, or you get the assignment to build one, you probably have a general idea of what you want to accomplish. It almost seems silly to say, but establishing clear research goals is one of the first imperatives for a great campaign.

Here are a few key research questions to start with:
<ul>
	<li><em>Who is the audience?</em> This is seldom a simple answer. There usually are multiple audiences, and the primary audience probably has different segments within it. It is important to really know who you are trying to reach in order to speak to their values.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>What’s the decision we want them to make?</em> While awareness is important, the ultimate goal of any successful campaign is to get people to make a change.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>What are the competing decisions that people might make, and what are the messages associated with them?</em> Political types will tell you about the importance of opposition research. Military strategists emphasize the importance of knowing your enemy. Even the most benign of campaigns confronts the prospect of inertia.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><em>What’s the context within which these decisions are being made?</em> This is partly a recognition that we’re in a fast-changing environment. But it’s also an acknowledgement that decisions seldom are made in a vacuum, and it’s important to understand what aspects of one’s environment – and lifestyle – are engaged in this specific decision.</li>
</ul>
A good place to start FOR finding the answers to these questions is within your own organization. But don’t stop there. Check the publicly available sources to see what else is being released on the issue.

If your campaign has to do with public policy or public norms, there are foundations, associations and companies that are already engaged in the field and have done studies that they release for public review. These likely won’t have everything you need to know, but they’ll help you start to answer your questions. Ultimately, you want to be able to make a good estimate about what is already known and what you still need to find out.

<strong>Motivation Research.  </strong>

The basics are important, but when your goal is to change the way that people think and behave, it’s important to really understand what motivates them. Here’s where we have a passion and an approach. We call it Motivation Research.

Motivation Research is built around the means-end theory of decision-making, used by some of the best marketers and communicators in the world for more than 50 years to build powerful and persuasive campaigns. It embodies the two key dimensions of persuasion: understanding the target audience’s personal values and the emotional links that tie those values to a specific decision.

The most effective persuasive communication is achieved by tying a “rational-emotional” connection to a specific decision or call to action. When people perceive that a specific decision will help them achieve personal values, the decision becomes more personally relevant. And personal relevance is what drives motivation.

The Motivation Research approach has a number of elements that set it apart. It uses probing techniques like qualitative research, but it employs an analytical structure that creates results like a quantitative study. Since it comes from psychology theory it’s not surprising that it uses questions like “how does that make you feel?” Most notably it creates graphical pictures known as decision maps that serve as excellent strategic thinking platforms.

Knowing where to meet your audience, and what will speak to their values and motivate them to take action, can only be found with good, solid research. Starting with the right questions will help you build a winning communications campaign, and hit your target.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>3 Ways to To Improve Breast Cancer Awareness Campaigns</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Breast cancer is a devastating disease that affects up to <a href="http://www.cancer.org/cancer/breastcancer/detailedguide/breast-cancer-key-statistics">1 in 8 women in their lifetime and kills tens of thousands annually</a>. This month millions of survivors, researchers, doctors, advocates, and communicators are raising awareness about breast cancer. But, to really make a difference, we need to do more than raise awareness. We need to focus on the best strategies for spreading information and moving women to actions that could save their lives. Here is some guidance from research featured on<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/"> frankology.</a>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/use-the-right-emotion-for-the-right-ask/">1) Use the Right Emotion for the Right Ask</a>

Emotion can be a powerful tool for motivating people to take action on their health, but are some more effective than others? Researcher and winner of the 2014 $10,000 frank research prize Jina Yoo tackled this question in her study of African American women and breast cancer. She found that informative videos that evoked feelings of sadness helped participants remember information about breast cancer risks, while videos that frightened participants made it harder for them to recall these messages.

Watch her <a href="https://vimeo.com/98664281">frank talk</a>.

2)  <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/what-women-want-young-women-use-their-phones-for-information-on-breast-cancer-prevention/">What Women Want: Young Use Their Phones For Information on Breast Cancer Prevention</a>

Breast cancer prevention shouldn’t start when a woman reaches middle age. That’s what makes messaging to younger women about the risks of breast cancer so important. A study conducted by Cynthia Kratzke, Aunp Amatya, and Hugo Vilchis of New Mexico State University suggests that a multimedia approach to informing young women about breast cancer prevention may be effective. After conducting a study of over 500 college-aged women, the researchers found significant support for breast cancer prevention apps and text messages, as well as for more traditional media outreach programs like web sites.

3) <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/getting-cancers-card-can-improve-survivors-knowledge/">Cancer Information Cards Improves Survivors' Knowledge</a>

Public health research has shown that low-income and minority women often don’t get the follow-up care that they need after initial treatment for a breast cancer diagnosis. That’s what makes the results of a new study conducted by Jesus G. Ulloa and his colleagues so important. Ulloa and his team found that providing wallet cards with information about tumor stage, treatment received, recurrence rates, and symptoms of recurrence can significantly raise the knowledge level of breast cancer survivors.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Well-told stories – in the right formats – can move people to action on important social issues.

In this <i>frank</i> playlist, we have gathered the talks of several expert practitioners who share their tips for telling compelling stories well.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Filmmakers
</strong>Kristina Robbins &amp; Marg Safinia: Getting Beyond the Choir.

[vimeo id="90161161" parameters="https://vimeo.com/90161161"]

Robbins and Safinia believe movies can grow your cause and help you reach the audience you want – not just the audience you already have. Nobody wants to be preached to; rather, Robbins and Safini say that if you want people to listen to you, you need to make a movie. Movies evoke deeper feelings, and make us question in ways that other storytelling strategies cannot. In their talk, Robbins and Safinia outline what it takes to make an effective movie that will highlight your cause and get your desired audience to act.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Social Marketing Strategist
</strong>Elizabeth Carger: Metaphors We Give By

[vimeo id="96719022" parameters="https://vimeo.com/90161161"]

Elizabeth Carger shares the neuroscience behind strategic storytelling. Carter says that people think in images, not words. So to reach people, you need to translate ideas into images through metaphorical storytelling to make neurological connections. Doing so will create deep connections between your message and your audience and even move them to action.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Journalist
</strong>David Bornstein: Problems Shout, Solutions Whisper

[vimeo id="101934522" parameters="https://vimeo.com/90161161"]

David Bornstein explains that traditional journalism only tells people what’s going wrong. This gloom and doom approach leaves people overwhelmed. Bornstein says that people need a sense of efficacy to engage with a clear call to action. Journalists need to show the bright spots and an aspirational path to change. Doing so not only makes people feel like they can be successful, but also increases the chances that your story will go viral.

&nbsp;

<strong>The Documentarian:
</strong>Ross Kauffman: finding the heart of social change

[vimeo id="120885602" parameters="https://vimeo.com/90161161"]

Academy Award winning documentary filmmaker Ross Kauffman talks about his experience producing “Born into Brothels”—a film that follows documentary photographer Zana Briski who teaches photography to eight children born into Calcutta brothels. The children use photography to document their experiences on the streets, and improve their lives. Kauffman emphasizes "inviting people to emotion" rather than calling them to action. His advice to anyone trying to achieve social impact: "…just try to reach out to people and let them feel. Once people feel, then they will come together.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the small town of Gainesville, Florida, a place we call home, is a community of change makers, artists and general badasses that anyone would want to grab a drink with and talk shop. One of those residents is development and documentary photographer <a href="http://www.charlottekeslphoto.com">Charlotte Kesl</a>.

Charlotte, a real life renaissance woman and globetrotter, engages in a number of projects. She is the Communications Manger for <a href="http://www.projectcordillera.org">Project Cordillera</a>, a social enterprise that offers expeditions in the Andes while supporting mountain communities. She is also an instructor for <a href="http://www.momentaworkshops.com">Momenta Workshops</a>, a photography company that specializes in training photographers in documentary storytelling.

I first met Charlotte at a party, and as I got to know her my mouth dropped to the floor in awe of her work. I wanted to know more about her work and the role of photography in driving change. So, we caught up over coffee and talked about the importance of photography, particularly for social change organizations seeking to tell their stories and drive change.

A: <b>Let’s start off by getting to know you. Tell us about your work.</b>

C: I grew up in Gainesville and moved to Washington, DC, for my undergraduate studies. I moved abroad to Colombia in 2010, and since then I’ve worked and lived in Peru, Uganda, Sierra Leone, Spain and earned a Masters in Media, Communication and Development from the London School of Economics.<i> </i>I specialize in documentary photography and communications for development. I’ve photographed for projects ranging from international education and public health initiatives, to small community based organizations working with ex-combatants or disabled children and many things in-between.

<b>A: Wow! Get it, girl! What is it that brought you to photography?</b>

C: I always enjoyed photographing, but it wasn’t until I was hired as an assistant for photojournalist, Jamie Rose, in 2007, that I realized I could pursue photography as a career. I still work with Jamie to this day, who is the COO of Momenta. I was really fortunate to have incredible mentors and people who’ve pushed me. Every time I photograph in a community, I learn more about myself as a photographer and about how resilient the human spirit is, especially in post-conflict areas. Photography has allowed me to connect with so many different types of individuals, many whom I never would have met if I wasn’t photographing with a purpose.

<b>A: So, what are you working on now?</b>

C: Next week, I’ll be returning to Sierra Leone, a place I called home for the majority of 2013, as an instructor for <a href="http://www.momentaworkshops.com">Momenta Workshops</a>. Our Project series matches each workshop attendee with a nonprofit assignment. With on-the-ground training, the photographer produces photo stories centered around humanitarian and social issues relevant to each nonprofit. The aim is to allow our nonprofit partners to see first hand the value and the power of strong visuals and for the photographers to improve their skillset.

I also recently returned from Peru, where we were gathering content for our new website for Project Cordillera. It just launched! After traveling a lot and seeing how tourism impacts communities around the world, it’s been really rewarding forming a social enterprise with a group of likeminded people who understand the importance of sustainable tourism.

<b>A: In your experience, how can photography be used to drive social change?</b>

C: Photography for social change is fundamental to storytelling and enables social change groups and organizations to <i>show</i> the impact of their projects. This might seem straightforward, but identifying photography as a crucial element in an organization’s communications strategy is something that should be at the top of the list. Hiring professional image-makers to produce strong imagery has the power to create an emotional connection to the organizations’ work, which can lead to an increase in funding and support. By working with a photographer who has spent time perfecting their craft, the organization is investing in someone who can capture beneficiaries with dignity and deliver their message.

<b>A: What it unique about photographing for social change organizations?</b>

C: Photography is storytelling, and storytelling for social change organizations is more complex than showing how people’s lives have changed. For example, for NGOs, instead of focusing on how the group is improving the lives of their beneficiaries. I think it’s important to focus on the person, the beneficiary and explore how people have used the resources from the NGO. Positive storytelling and being creative with the approach to illustrate the success of an organization’s projects is the exciting challenge that documentarians are presented with.

<strong>A: Can you talk about one of your favorite images?</strong>

C: My real passion is photographing people. I worked with Yoga Strength, a CBO (community based organization) that works with ex-combatants and teaches them yoga in Freetown, Sierra Leone. It’s an incredible group of young men (and some women,) and we went around to different parts of the city to stage photographs of different yoga poses. The photographs were used to fundraise money to build the first yoga studio in Sierra Leone (which was successfully completed in 2013!) Some of those images are probably my favorite.

<strong>A: How can change makers use photography to drive their messages?</strong>

C: Photography is a powerful medium to draw in and engage an audience. It’s really important to think about who your main audience is and what you want your message to be. Knowing why you’re telling a story will help create a narrative- which is how people make sense of the world around us.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Every summer, the </i><a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org"><i>Frank Karel Fellowship</i></a><i> places undergraduate students who are first-generation college students and/or represent diverse racial, ethnic and social backgrounds in an eight-week summer internship within the communications team of a carefully selected nonprofit organization. </i>

<i>The Fellowship honors and advances the legacy of Frank Karel, who established, led and nurtured the field of strategic communications in philanthropy during his 30 years as chief communications officer for the Robert Wood Johnson and Rockefeller Foundations.</i>

<i>Karel believed that racial and ethnic minorities should be better represented in the communications field and that we should be proactive in recruiting and nurturing broader participation and leadership in the advocacy and communications fields.</i>

<i>Throughout their fellowship, the nonprofit offers students guidance, career advice, substantive work assignments, networking and applied experience. This year’s nonprofit hosts included Special Olympics, the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids and DC Vote.  </i>

<i>In this new series, we hear from the latest cohort of students on their experience as Karel Fellows and what they learned.  This week we are sharing Aaron Zeiler’s blog on the 10 lessons he learned during his summer fellowship with Tobacco Free Kids. </i>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~</p>
My Karel Fellowship has been one of the greatest experiences of my life, filled with laughs, a couple of tears, occasional moments of stress and so many stories of getting lost in D.C.

I was placed at <a href="http://www.tobaccofreekids.org">the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids</a> this summer, and I learned how important Public Interest Communications is. It is amazing to see how one team can take the collective passion of a whole organization and share it with the world to make change.

&nbsp;

<strong> Top 10 lessons I have learned during my summer with Tobacco Free Kids</strong>

10. I learned how to spell tobacco. It has one B and two C’s. It was a rough first week, but I finally got the hang of it.

9. I learned how to use Twitter. I surprised a lot of people because I said I didn’t know how to use Twitter. Was I the only millennial who didn’t tweet? It’s hard fitting all your thoughts into 140 characters when you can barely use 140 words to describe them. Thankfully, my mentor Mina Radman, a past Karel Fellow who now works at Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, was very patient with me and taught me how to make a tweet stick out. I even got to write a few!<a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Twitter-with-Megaphone.jpg">
</a>

8. I learned how to speak with a member of Congress. During the Youth Advocacy Symposium, Mina and I sat with two youth advocates as they talked to their senators. These two young ladies walked with confidence into the Oregon and Alaska senate offices to discuss the need for regulation on e-cigarettes and cigarillos. I was amazed by their knowledge and passion for change.

7. I learned that “in the fight against Tobacco, youth voices pack a powerful punch.” Part of my job was to write the news releases for the 26 youth advocates so they could send them to their local newspapers. I read each of their stories, and I realized they had stories similar to mine. Their family members and friends have gotten sick or died from tobacco use, and it has pushed them to make a difference in their communities. I want to do public interest communications so I can share these stories and help them make change.

6. I learned that 95 percent of smokers start before age 21. Because tobacco companies know this, they target youth with magazine ads and flavored e-cigarettes/cigars. In addition to youth, companies target African-Americans, women and LGBT individuals.

5. In fact, tobacco companies spend $1 million every hour on their advertising.

4. I learned that when they are challenged, tobacco companies have no problem suing entire countries like Australia and Uruguay. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UsHHOCH4q8">John Oliver even did a segment on his show about it</a>:

During the summer, Danny Hakim of the New York Times did a series of articles about how the U.S. Chamber of Commerce actually lobbied for Big Tobacco across the world, stopping anti-smoking legislation.

3. I learned that public interest communications is a fluid, ever-changing field that requires some planning and a good reaction time. For example, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/01/business/international/us-chamber-works-globally-to-fight-antismoking-measures.html">when Danny Hakim</a> released a story about the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (COC) fighting antismoking measures in foreign countries, I saw the international communications team come to life and direct their focus to the COC. I went from looking up journalists on Cision (a media database, research tool) to protesting outside the COC with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R0M1hduugMU">Jeff the Diseased Lung</a>.

2. I learned that you rely a lot on other people. I could not have made it through this summer without the help of my other fellows (Kindra, Nergis, Betzaida, Lauren, Milliecia and Marcia) and my co-workers, especially Mina. Communications is tough; that is why you have friends who can help you through because they have been through it too.

1. The most important thing I learned this summer is how to turn passion into practice. My grandfather, Papa, was my hero and my best friend, and I lost him when I was 11 years old to stage four lung cancer. I’m angry that tobacco companies intentionally market to me in hopes that I’ll be a “replacement smoker.” CTFK has taught me that I can help fight back. I can use communications to tell these stories to share what I have learned in order to make a difference so that one day we can have a tobacco-free generation.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/izUm2b0a.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-11730" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/izUm2b0a.jpg" alt="izUm2b0a" width="400" height="400" /></a></p>
There are no words to describe how grateful I am for this experience and for everyone who has shown me the power of public interest communications. Now I return to Gainesville to share my experience and hopefully make a difference.

		<title>Bipartisan Science and a Call to Action</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/10/a-call-to-action-from-andy-burness/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In today's political climate, science is often treated as a partisan issue. Whether it is climate change or vaccinations, scientific consensus is often characterized as special interest politics.

However, in the new issue of<a href="http://issues.org"> <i>Issues in Science and Technolog</i></a>y, <a href="http://www.burness.com">Andy Burness</a>, writes about “Bipartisan Science," and calls for an effort to organize behind research that can attract both Republican and Democrat support.

“In these polarized times, research that has the best chance of attaining significance in the policy world is research on a topic that can somehow sidestep politics or point toward solutions that can appeal to competing ideologies,” he writes.

In his article, Burness shares three examples of bipartisan policies, informed by research, that created positive social change. Specifically, Burness outlines three cases, where research-based advocacy led to policy changes in Medicaid, financial saving programs and pharmaceutical reform.

The excerpt below was originally published in the article <a href="http://issues.org/32-1/bipartisan-science/">Bipartisan Science</a>.

“…there has been a seemingly endless chorus of concern that doesn’t seem to be dying down, calling for scientists to be better communicators. I am a member of that chorus. The theory is that better communication will lead to public support for needed scientific research, greater acceptance of validated scientific findings, and greater funding for research across the scientific spectrum. The “science of science communication” has itself become a subject for research championed by the National Academies. Programs such as The Aldo Leopold Leadership Program (started in 1998 by Oregon State University ecologist and former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration director Jane Lubchenco) have been created to train scientists to communicate more effectively to decisions makers. Duke and SUNY-Stony Brook offer workshops to train faculty and students, and scientific societies sponsor countless “Hill visit days” to bring scientists to Washington to speak to legislators.

But, by and large, scientists don’t appear much further along as a “cohort” (a word they would use) than they were three decades ago. Bitter disagreements over climate change, stem cell research, health care policy, education policy, and regulating air pollution and toxic chemicals often seem remarkably insensitive to scientific voices, however articulate and compelling. Meanwhile, social science research has revealed that attitudes about such issues are more a matter of whom one trusts and what core values are at stake than what “the evidence” says.

Could it be that those of us who are proponents of science communication might be asking the wrong question this many years later? I suspect we’re focusing disproportionately on the imperative to communicate as an end in itself and neglecting the underlying political stakes. In these hyper-partisan times, a more strategic and effective approach might instead focus on identifying research findings that can actually help to skirt politics, seeking opportunities when effective communication of science might draw bipartisan support that actually leads to policy change.

It turns out that there is a history of successes, even recent ones, where science actually informed and even inspired policy agreements across the political aisles. These are successes where, without the science, government or institutional policies in the public interest would never have been enacted. We should pay close attention to these, because learning why some science communication translates to policy change would move us beyond communication for its own sake to a more strategic purpose.”

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Halloween is just around the corner, which means that all the ghosts and ghouls will be coming out to play. But research suggests that fear isn’t just fun on Halloween – it can actually be a surprisingly effective emotion for encouraging action on social problems. These three studies show you how your communications campaign can keep the Halloween spirit alive year-round and make the world a better place in the process.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-to-boo-st-action-on-climate-change/">1) How to Boo-st Action on Climate Change</a>

Climate change is an objectively terrifying problem, and the sheer magnitude of the issue can cause people to tune it out. But researcher Shu-Chu Sarrina Li found that a little bit of fear can be a good thing when it comes to communicating on the climate. The key is pairing feelings of fear with a call to action – like asking them to raise the temperature on their AC – that lets people feel like they can fight back.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/some-ghoulish-findings-about-fear-of-death-and-charitable-giving/">2) Some Ghoulish Findings About Fear of Death and Charitable Giving</a>

Why should skeletons and spirits only make an appearance at the end of October when there’s good reason to bring them to your fundraisers no matter the season? According to a study conducted by researchers Tomasz Zaleskiewicz, Agata Gasiorowska, and Pelin Kesebir, reminding people of their own mortality can actually make them more generous. We feel anxious when we consider death, and charitable actions can help soothe these fears.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/frighteningly-effective-scare-parents-to-increases-vaccination-intentions/">3) Frighteningly Effective: Scare Parents to Increase Vaccination Intentions</a>

Halloween is full of scary stories, but the return of preventable childhood illnesses is no campfire tale. There’s good news, though. A study by Zachary Horne, John E. Hummel, Derek Powell and Keith J. Holyoak suggests that scaring parents about the dangers of not vaccinating their children through graphic photos and stories of deadly illnesses can increase vaccination intentions.

So this Halloween, don’t be afraid of things that go bump in the night. It might just be a good communications campaign.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Every summer, the </i><a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org"><i>Frank Karel Fellowship</i></a><i> places undergraduate students who are first-generation college students and/or represent diverse racial, ethnic and social backgrounds in an eight-week summer internship within the communications team of a carefully selected nonprofit organization. </i>

<i>The Fellowship honors and advances the legacy of Frank Karel, who established, led and nurtured the field of strategic communications in philanthropy during his 30 years as chief communications officer for the Robert Wood Johnson and Rockefeller Foundations.</i>

<i>Karel believed that racial and ethnic minorities should be better represented in the communications field and that we should be proactive in recruiting and nurturing broader participation and leadership in the advocacy and communications fields.</i>

<i>Throughout their fellowship, the nonprofit offers students guidance, career advice, substantive work assignments, networking and applied experience. This year’s nonprofit hosts included Special Olympics, the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids and DC Vote.  </i>

<i>In this new series, we hear from the latest cohort of students on their experience as Karel Fellows and what they learned.  This week we are sharing Marcia Puig-Lluch's post on How to Trend Change.</i>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~</p>
I can honestly say that this has been one of the most eye-opening summers I’ve ever had. I came into this internship not really knowing what to expect with communications and advocacy appearing in my mind like vague ideas as opposed to concrete, strategic concepts.  As I try to put into words all the things that I have learned, the one thing that really sticks out is how much more there is still out there for me to learn.

I participated in a Twitter storm from 2 to 3 p.m. on July 28 to trend <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23blackwomenequalpay&amp;src=tyah">#BlackWomenEqualPay</a> and mark the fact that black women make a mere 64 cents to every white man’s dollar. My contribution to this Twitter storm was through <a href="http://www.wowonline.org/">WOW’s (Wider Opportunities for Women)</a> lens of economic security, and how lack of wage equity is one of the reasons why economic insecurity affects the lives of women, families, and, as it compounds, of seniors.<a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Department-of-Labor.png"><img class="wp-image-640 alignleft" src="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Department-of-Labor-300x169.png" alt="Department of Labor" width="359" height="216" /></a>

The Twitter storm started out slow. I could see the first tentative tweets appearing intermittently – every two or three minutes. But then the momentum started building up, and the movement started growing. Before I knew it, my Tweetdeck was blowing up – it seemed like every tweet was about #BlackWomenEqualPay, every advocacy group was adding their unique contribution; Representatives, Senators, even the Department of Labor were tweeting about it. But what I thought was most powerful were the individuals who took part in it, who really had nothing to do with the movement except that #BlackWomenEqualPay was their reality. They were living the fact that they were only making 64 cents to a man’s dollar, and having a platform for them to tell their personal stories and participate in this larger conversation is what public interest communications is all about.

And to think I’d never even tweeted before.

Beyond my experience at Wider Opportunities for Women, what I really enjoyed about this fellowship was going to other organizations and hearing about what work they were doing. The organizations that participated in this year’s fellowship were so diverse – the Save the Children Action Network, the Special Olympics and DC Vote, to name just a few. They each covered such a broad range of issues and it was great to see how they were each able to carve their own little niche in the advocacy world. I feel so fortunate to have been able to learn a little bit more about the passionate people that work there and their own personal stories as to how they got into the non-profit world.

I went out for tea with a co-worker the other day, and she told me about the amazing journey she took to get to where she is now. There was one thing she said that I had never heard before and that I loved: the first time she came to D.C. she got Potomac Fever. This city has a particular energy that simply buzzes with a desire to see positive change in the world. I think I might have caught the fever, too. And as I move on to my junior year at American University, I know that I will be taking that energy with me, and that it will motivate me to not only continue working as an advocate (whether professionally or personally is something that only time will tell), but how important it is to be able to communicate effectively in everything that I do.

		<title>Why Commercial Marketers Make Bad Behavior Change Marketers</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2015/11/why-commercial-marketers-make-bad-behavior-change-marketers/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever seen a commercial, billboard or online campaign that made you scream, “I wish we could do that!” You’re not alone. Health communicators and other behavior change practitioners often fantasize about creating campaigns like Apple or Nike. These marketers motivate consumers to buy billions of products and services.  It’s natural to experience this sort of “influence envy.”

For decades, this flawed thinking has led countless behavior change programs to knock on the doors of ad agencies for help. “Make colon cancer screenings as hip as Apple,” we tell them; or “Make breast feeding as luxurious as Chanel.” We’ve all been there, deep in the fantasy of using commercial marketing to cause positive social change. There’s only one problem. Commercial marketing and behavior change marketing are fundamentally different. And this difference has led countless of well-intentioned behavior change campaigns to fail.

In the commercial space, marketing is typically trying to convince a person to change their brand preference. For example, Pepsi isn’t trying to convince you to start drinking soda; it’s trying to convince soda drinkers to drink <i>their</i> soda. Don’t believe me? Ask Pepsi for their “organic juice drinker conversion to soda drinker strategy.” They don’t have one. Why? Because it would be a colossal waste of money for Pepsi to attempt such a significant change in behavior. Instead, they go after people who already drink soda. So, Pepsi, along with thousands of other commercial marketers, are not trying to change behaviors. They're trying to change brand preferences.

In contrast, you are trying to change behavior. And trying to convince someone to stop smoking, start recycling or exercise more is as ludicrous as turning an organic juice drinker into soda drinker. Nonetheless, we work towards these changes in behavior everyday. And attempting to achieve such audacious outcomes requires different strategies than brand preference change.

The differences between behavior change and commercial marketing could fill a book. But, I want to explain one critical difference; the “core audience fallacy.” Commercial marketing campaigns are typically looking to expand their base of customers with other like-minded consumers. This requires that every campaign they create appeal to the core audience. Then, they expose like-minded people to this campaign in hopes that they too will choose their product over the competitor’s. In other words, the core audience is crucial in a commercial marketing campaign.

Conversely, behavior change efforts should usually avoid the “core audience.” To cause sizable behavior change, a campaign must give an entire group of people a reason to change their behavior that is unique to them.

For example, my company,<a href="http://rescuescg.com"> Rescue Social Change Group</a>, does a significant amount of work in tobacco control. Tobacco behavior change requires that we associate living tobacco-free with the lifestyles and identities of those who currently smoke. However, the fact that these individuals are smokers makes them different from people who hate smoking.

In this example, what the commercial world calls its “core audience” would be non-smokers. So a commercial marketing campaign would attempt to reach these committed non-smokers as part of their campaign. But, if non-smokers and smokers are fundamentally different, then targeting non-smokers ensures that a campaign will miss its mark. Thus, to be effective, an anti-tobacco campaign must ignore the “core audience” to target smokers directly; by embracing their unique values and lifestyles to motivate them to change.

At face value, this seems obvious. Yet, the number of public health campaigns that fail to recognize this are countless. Think about the number of healthy eating campaigns you’ve seen that feature skinny, affluent, White people. Or the number of binge drinking campaigns that show people who look like they’ve never drank more than a wine spritzer. Or the number of teen tobacco prevention campaigns that feature kids who look like the next student body president. And this just scratches the surface. Beyond what the people featured in a campaign look like, the value differences between “users” and “non-users” make many of these messages irrelevant to the target audience.

Why does this happen? Well, unfortunately, most marketers misunderstand the unique principles of behavior change. These commercial marketers are drawn to their core audiences like a gravitational pull. This is what they do everyday. And they will use their logical arguments, refined through years of selling widgets, to convince you their approach is right.

Unfortunately, they’re wrong.

To change behavior we must change one of the factors that are leading people to engage in the unwanted behavior.  More often than not, it’s a daunting task. But, it is doable as long as you target your research, resources and messages to the right audience.

In addition, you must be able to correct commercial marketers when they try to “preach to the choir.” Mind you, working with a commercial marketing agency is not the only go way to go. There are hundreds of behavior change marketing companies that think about changing behavior everyday (Disclaimer: I am the President of one of these companies).

But, if you do work with an ad agency, make sure that you exert your position as the behavior change expert. Do not let them fool you with the core audience fallacy. Focus on the values and lifestyles of those who need to change.

So, next time you experience influence envy, ask yourself, is this ad changing behavior? Or is it just making its core audience feel loved?

<p style="text-align: center;">~~</p>

<div class="entry-content">

<img class="alignright" src="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Lauren-Shiplett-CBPP-Field-Trip1.jpg" alt="My Karel Experience: Lessons Learned" width="417" height="312" />I don’t know everything.

Looking back at my grade school years, I can’t pinpoint my learning to a specific time frame. I don’t know the exact day I learned to write an essay or divide the long way, and I can’t definitively tell you what I learned from year to year. But, thanks to a combination of maturity, age, and experience, I can look back at the lessons I was presented with this summer and recognize that I learned them over the last few months as a Karel fellow. These lessons hopefully reveal not only how much I learned during the fellowship, but how I ultimately changed and grew as a communicator, student, and advocate.

<strong>1. Put the politics aside</strong>

Long story short – my host organization is fiscally liberal, I am not. But this summer, I learned that part of being a better communicator is at least trying to understand others’ ideas, even if I didn’t think I could. After seeing how adamant some coworkers were about their beliefs (and often seeing the same from the other side), I recognize how polarization and politics have limited cooperation and collaboration, and now always want to be cognizant of how I approach working with those I don’t agree with.

<strong>2. My work matters</strong>

I sometimes felt bogged down in the nuances, e-mails, and drafts of everyday work, especially as an intern jumping in mid-stream. The turning point was after I had taken notes on a Senate hearing for the highway trust fund and dispersed them to analysts at my organization; the trust fund soon came to the forefront of the political realm, and I realized my notes could lead to an analyst influencing policy or a lawmaker. I learned to take a step back and truly appreciate my role, not only in my workplace, but also as a mechanism of social change.<strong> </strong>

<strong>3. Being better means thinking bigger</strong><strong> </strong>

I learned that being a better communicator means always thinking of the bigger picture. I’ve learned to constantly ask myself two big questions: what I do, and why I do it. The fellowship not only taught me to think about my role within systems of social change, but to constantly remember my mission and why I’m there in the first place. This summer, I was there to learn and improve the lives of low-income Americans, regardless of political differences or monotonous workdays, and it was encouraging to hit the refresh button and remind myself of that from time to time.

If there’s one thing this experience has taught me, it’s that I have a long way to go and a lot to learn. I
know my passion is communication, but after hearing about the many opportunities and paths of the professionals who mentored me, I have no idea where I’ll go with it or what I’ll do next. Ultimately, the Karel fellowship led me to the doorstep of my future; whatever I do or wherever I go with communications, I’ve learned to always seek the public interest and never stop advocating for a better tomorrow.

I want to sincerely thank the Karel Advisory Board, the program administrators, the unforgettable fellows, my mentor, Caroline Anderson, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities for this life-changing experience. It’s because of these people, and the vibrant public interest communications community, I was able to learn these life-changing lessons, and can one day pass them on to others.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<b></b>There are some campaigns that never leave us. With the right message, call to action and design, a campaign can have long-lasting influence and resonance.

In this <i>frank</i> playlist, we have gathered the talks from the brains behind some of the most famous and impactful communications campaigns – from Lift Up Oakland, to (RED), to the Red Equal Sign campaign. Watch these practitioners share their work and what drives their passion and success.

<b>Jenifer Willig: What's Your Motive?</b>

[vimeo id="92185218"]

<a href="https://twitter.com/jwillig">Jenifer Willig </a>is the co-founder of <a href="http://wholeworldwater.co">WHOLE WORLD Water,</a> a social enterprise uniting the hospitality and tourism industry to raise money for clean and safe water projects around the world, and <a href="http://the-motive.com">Motive,</a> a social innovation consultancy working with large companies like NYSE Euronext &amp; Old Navy to position and scale their social investments. Prior to the WHOLE WORLD Water and Motive, Willig led the<a href="http://www.red.org/en/U2"> (RED) </a>organization founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver to fight AIDS in Africa. During her four-year tenure, (RED) raised $185 million by partnering with iconic brands including Nike, Apple, Dell, Microsoft and Starbucks and became a global brand with a social following of more than 2.5 million advocates.

In her talk, Willig shares her experience building the brand of (RED) and the potential for businesses in having social impact without sacrificing their bottom line, citing her own business WHOLE WORLD Water as an example.

&nbsp;

<b>Anastasia Khoo: Art of Going Viral</b>

[vimeo id="120729669"]

<a href="http://www.hrc.org/staff/profile/anastasia-khoo">Anastasia Khoo</a> is the managing director for <a href="http://hrc.org">Human Rights' Campaign</a>. She helped create the record-breaking “red equal sign” in support of marriage equality. The red equal sign was named the logo the <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2014/01/06/260036316/equal-sign-named-symbol-of-the-year-for-2013">“Symbol of the Year" </a>in 2013 by the Symbolic Systems Program. Under her leadership, the Human Rights Campaign has evolved into a public relations and digital powerhouse. The organization has won every single major public relations and digital award available, and Khoo, herself, has been honored with numerous awards. In fact, later this week PR News will honor her as one of the top women in the field as a “PR Women of the Year.”

In her talk, Jenifer shows us that sometimes you just have to do things without asking. For her, this meant planning a complete takeover of social media to promote marriage equality.

&nbsp;

<b>Jim Ross and Jennifer Webber: Timing is Everything</b>

[vimeo id="120729665"]

<a href="http://jimrossconsulting.nationbuilder.com/about">Jim Ross</a> is a political strategists with more than twenty years of campaign management experience. Ross “managed and won, candidate and initiative campaigns at the local, state and federal levels, as well as helped build a statewide small business organization in California, has run city council campaigns in New York City, has worked to defeat ballot measures in San Francisco, and has assisted in preserving open space in the San Francisco Bay Area.”

<a href="http://www.webberpublicaffairs.com/jennifer-webber-biography/"> Jennifer Webber </a>is a strategist based in Oakland, California, who works with a range of clients including candidates for public office, nonprofits and advocacy groups. Webber has worked on higher education and affordability issues, as well as “grown and coordinated a national coalition of consumer, labor, civil rights, veterans and college access organizations whose goal is to ensure that taxpayer-funded federal financial aid does not go to poor quality, predatory career education programs that leave students buried in debt they cannot repay. “

Ross and Webber share their work with Lift Up Oakland to support a ballot initiative in Oakland, California. They discuss their strategic use of media to drive the politics of the campaign, which was vital in making the community more aware of the issues covered by the ballot initiative.

		<title>Fellow Friday: From on the Ground to Behind the Scenes</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Every summer, the </i><a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/"><i>Frank Karel Fellowship</i></a><i> places undergraduate students who are first-generation college students and/or represent diverse racial, ethnic and social backgrounds in an eight-week summer internship within the communications team of a carefully selected nonprofit organization. </i>

<i>The Fellowship honors and advances the legacy of Frank Karel, who established, led and nurtured the field of strategic communications in philanthropy during his 30 years as chief communications officer for the Robert Wood Johnson and Rockefeller Foundations.</i>

<i>Karel believed that racial and ethnic minorities should be better represented in the communications field and that we should be proactive in recruiting and nurturing broader participation and leadership in the advocacy and communications fields.</i>

<i>Throughout their fellowship, the nonprofit offers students guidance, career advice, substantive work assignments, networking and applied experience. This year’s nonprofit hosts included Special Olympics, the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids and DC Vote.  </i>

<i>In this new series, we hear from the latest cohort of students on their experience as Karel Fellows and what they learned.  This week we are sharing Kindra Nicol<strong>'</strong>s post on the lessons she learned during her summer fellowship at <a href="http://www.savethechildrenactionnetwork.org/site/c.csIRI8NIK9KYF/b.9167393/k.BE72/Home.htm">Save the Children Action Network</a>.</i>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~</p>
All I have ever wanted to do was make a difference in the world. Honestly, I did not have a specific idea about how I wanted to make the world a better place or even create a change. When I first went to Africa and volunteered at an orphanage, I connected with the children placed there. Their families could not afford the adequate healthcare they needed. On that day and because of those moments with the children, I knew I was going to help people in the future.

My summer as a Karel fellow allowed me to witness how to make a change in the lives of others from another perspective. As I transitioned from on the ground to behind the scenes, I was not making a change for a day, but I was creating a systemic change that will help people overtime through public policy. I was able to support issues related to early childhood education and the mother and infant mortality rates for generations to come.<a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sign.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-623 alignright" src="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sign-300x296.jpg" alt="sign" width="300" height="296" /></a>

I grew up a bit this summer and dove right into advocacy. I made my desires of being an advocate a reality. I can say I worked on an early childhood education campaign that encourages presidential candidates to make early childhood education a priority. This will help ensure that every child in the United States has access to high quality early childhood education programs no matter where they live.

I can say that I had the opportunity to sit in on a meeting with a coalition of non-profit organizations to discuss a maternal newborn and child survival bill that made me frustrated because people were concerned with making sure that an even number of Republicans or Democrats would be able to support the bill or that there was a political figure to support and endorse the bill.

I became so passionate about this initivate because I remembered the children that I worked with in the orphanage in Tanzania. It took me some time but looking back, I realize that the only way to make a real change is to gain political support to bring awareness to the issues around the world.

I can say that I went to my first Capitol Hill drop event and became a lobbyist for a day to persuade senators and their staffers to support the “Reach Every Mother and Child” Act; a bipartisan policy that was developed to end preventable child and maternal deaths worldwide by 2035. I knew I had evolved into an advocate because I was able to communicate a message to bring awareness to a social issue that I became passionate about and I then shared the same message with others.<a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Save-the-kids.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-558 alignleft" src="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Save-the-kids-300x88.jpg" alt="Save the kids" width="300" height="88" /></a>

When people asked me what I wanted to do in the future for my career I would say, “I want to make a change” or “I want to help people and become a social entrepreneur.” Now when people ask me that same exact question. I can say I want to be an advocate for children around the world because every child deserves to have the same and equal opportunities in life.

After completing the Frank Karel Fellowship, I now know what kind of advocate I want to be in the future. One day I am going to work on the ground with the children around the world and think of creative ways to solve their issues. I am going to work behind the scenes to create a significant systematic change through public policy. I am beyond thankful and grateful that this fellowship has made my future career aspirations a clear vision. I have realized that this is what I am here for and what I am going to do for the rest of my life. I have found my voice, and I am going to use it for all the children who do not have one and for all the voices that go unheard.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[November is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month and also the start of Movember, a month-long campaign to raise money and encourage men to get screened for the disease. During Movember, men are challenged to grow out their facial hair and share their ‘staches on social media.

An examination of the campaign provides some insights about what works and what falls short in communicating to men about health issues.

As a fundraiser, Movember has been quite a success. In less than a decade, it has raised more than $300M. That money now supports more prostate cancer research than any non-government agency in the world,” said researchers Richard Wassersug and John L Oliffe from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, who have <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Richard_Wassersug/publication/263934284_On_manhood_and_Movemberor_why_the_moustache_works/links/54485b6a0cf22b3c14e30dc2.pdf">studied</a> this and other prostate cancer campaigns.

According Wassersug and Oliffe, the campaign’s strategic use of masculinity is what sets this campaign apart from the others.

The researchers say Movember uses humor and competition to effectively tap into men’s sense of masculinity.

“Movember encourages men to compete about the appearance of their mustaches. This sets up a situation where a male can participate in a competition that affirms his manhood without ever seriously challenging his masculinity,” the researchers said. “In the competition…the only males who could be considered emasculated (and only metaphorically of course) are those who decline to compete. By remaining free of facial hairs, they appear, by comparison, hypogonadal, that is, without enough testosterone to grow facial hair.”

While the growing of an epic ‘stache is a fun and competitive campaign that has been successful in raising money for research, the campaign has had little effect on men’s health behavior.

For example, one <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25903054">study</a> found that Twitter users who participated in the 2013 campaign in Canada rarely tweeted about the importance of screenings for prostate cancer.

The researchers found that out of the 2,400 tweets analyzed, 34 percent were fundraising related, only 18 percent called for making a change to men's health and 26 percent characterized the campaign as a mustache contest rather than a charity.

Similarly, another<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26511591"> study </a>found that “the Movember campaign had a limited immediate effect on (prostate cancer) referral(s), however, it may have contributed to an increased awareness of Prostate cancer.” The researchers found that during the month of the campaign, there was a slight increase in men referred to doctors for prostate cancer screenings, however, in the months that followed, there was no increase in referrals.

So what can we take away from this campaign and apply to our own work:
<ul>
	<li>The use of fun, competitive campaigns that tap into our audiences sense of self and values can be effective for raising awareness and funding.</li>
	<li>However, if your goal is to impact behavior, such as promoting preventive health measures, be careful not to let the gimmick overshadow your larger message. Or in this case, hide it behind a mustache.</li>
</ul>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>Every summer, the </i><a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/"><i>Frank Karel Fellowship</i></a><i> places undergraduate students who are first-generation college students and/or represent diverse racial, ethnic and social backgrounds in an eight-week summer internship within the communications team of a carefully selected nonprofit organization. </i>

<i>The Fellowship honors and advances the legacy of Frank Karel, who established, led and nurtured the field of strategic communications in philanthropy during his 30 years as chief communications officer for the Robert Wood Johnson and Rockefeller Foundations.</i>

<i>Karel believed that racial and ethnic minorities should be better represented in the communications field and that we should be proactive in recruiting and nurturing broader participation and leadership in the advocacy and communications fields.</i>

<i>Throughout their fellowship, the nonprofit offers students guidance, career advice, substantive work assignments, networking and applied experience. This year’s nonprofit hosts included Special Olympics, the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids and DC Vote.  </i>

<i>In this new series, we hear from the latest cohort of students on their experience as Karel Fellows and what they learned.  This week we are sharing <i>Nergis Lemus<strong>'</strong>s post on the lessons she learned during her summer fellowship at <a href="http://www.specialolympicsdc.org/">Special Olympics</a></i></i>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This past summer was full of excitement, knowledge and wonderful new experiences. Working at the Special Olympics during such a busy time has taught me more about myself than anything else. For starters, it has taught me that I still have so much to learn, but it is okay to not know everything right away. There were times I felt overwhelmed and lost for answers to complete my tasks. Granted, I didn’t let that bring me down. I am not a quitter. I researched and utilized my resources, and I discovered that I am capable of getting a job done with the knowledge I currently possess. This summer, working as an intern for the Special Olympics increased my overall confidence and ability to be self-sufficient in the workplace.</p>
Another piece of the puzzle that came together for me from this experience is a better understanding of my future. I learned that being an advocate<img class=" wp-image-649 alignright" src="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cartoon-300x270.gif" alt="Cartoon" width="210" height="211" /> for issues I believe in is the next step in my career path. Working behind the scenes helped me understand how much work and dedication goes into making a vision possible. I want to be a part of that vision!

When looking back at my personal life, I watched my youngest brother, Kamir, play for the Special Olympics knowing very little about the organization. This summer, however, opened up my eyes to see <img class="size-medium wp-image-648 alignleft" src="http://www.karelfellowship.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/11737805_10104318567678232_1509986631828601904_n-1-225x300.jpg" alt="11737805_10104318567678232_1509986631828601904_n (1)" width="225" height="300" />endless possibilities for him as an athlete with an intellectual disability. I wanted him to know that during my summer at the Special Olympics, I was been able to work toward something amazing that he can also take part of one day. I want him to aspire to be great at whatever he wants to do and know that his hard work will not go unnoticed.

Lastly, the summer would not have been nearly as exciting if it wasn’t for the other fellows. Each fellow has a unique personality that made our group full of life. I highly enjoyed visiting each of their organizations throughout the summer and look forward to keeping in touch with all of them. It will be a pleasant reunion at <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu">f</a><em><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu">rank</a> </em>when we will be able to come together once again.

This summer was a summer of a lifetime! I’m so glad I was able to be a part of something that made a difference. Thanks to the Frank Karel fellowship, I am one step closer to becoming the person I knew I could be. I end with a phrase I’ve really grown to embrace:

“Be the change that you wish to see in the world.” – Ghandi

		<title>4 studies on increasing empathy and donations this holiday season</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The holidays are about stuffing your face, avoiding your weird uncle, giving thanks, and – of course – giving back.

For many of you working for charities and organizations, the winter season is a time to tap into the holiday spirit and rev up calls for donations.

To kick things off, here are four studies that can help you increase empathy and donations for your cause. From increasing feelings of awe to taking a page out of the Black Friday playbook, read on to find out what these scientists suggest can increase generosity and giving this season.

<strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-power-of-awe-in-increasing-generosity/">The power of awe</a></strong>

New research suggests that increasing pro-social behaviors like generosity may be as simple as reminding people that they are part of something larger than themselves.

<strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-diversity-makes-us-more-empathetic/">Diversity makes us more empathetic</a></strong>

New research suggests that increased contact with people from different races can increase our empathy toward others. The study suggests that being exposed to people who are racially different from us can actually change how our brain reacts to them empathetically.

<strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/the-best-language-to-boost-donations/">Take a page out of the Black Friday playbook</a></strong>

Understanding how to use language effectively for fundraising is critical for non-profits, especially given the importance of annual fundraising events in boosting their financial reserves. But new research suggests that taking a page from the Black Friday playbook might be more lucrative. When it comes to charitable giving, it seems we can’t resist opportunities that come along “only once a year.”

<strong><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/some-ghoulish-findings-about-fear-of-death-and-charitable-giving/">Avoid the holiday spirit and try death</a></strong>

If you’re looking for a theme for your next fundraising campaign, here’s one you may want to consider: death. We’re serious. New research out of the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Wroclaw, Poland, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison suggests that reminding people of their mortality makes them more generous.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This week, our social media feeds are filled with expressions of gratitude.

As we come closer to <em>frank</em>2016, I’m reminded of how much we have to be grateful for. In building <em>frank</em>, we are part of a community that allows us each to do our work better, to see greatness in those around us and emulate it, and to recognize that someone else’s excellence takes nothing from us and is, in fact, an opportunity for greater enrichment. In this community, we simultaneously strive to do our own work well and to share the best of what we have and know because our competition is not each other, but injustice, hatred, a damaged climate and inequality.

This snippet from a 1990 New York Times interview with Martha Graham captures this idea precisely:
<blockquote><em>"You have to accept the fact – and be grateful for the fact – that you are part of something great. You have to move forward believing that you are part of something that has merit, and you have to work hard to be of merit yourself."</em></blockquote>
Ms. Graham was talking about the dance world, but her words apply just as well to what we’re creating together. If you have been to <em>frank</em>, helped to plan <em>frank</em> or regularly visit this site, you already understand the thing that makes it extraordinary. It is that each and every person who contributes gives the best of themselves.  You bring your strongest connection. Your hardest work. Your boldest ideas. Your sharpest insight. What we’re building together is great because of what you contribute.

The urgency of the problems that face the world at this moment demand nothing less than this shared effort. We don’t have enough money or time to get it wrong.

In that same interview, Ms. Graham said, “<em>Through all the struggles, I was grateful always that I was in the right struggle, and I think that is what saved me.”</em>

Public interest communications — using science-based communications to drive lasting change on issues that transcend the interest of any single organization — is not new. But recognizing it as a discipline, sharing the best of what you’ve learned from the front line and finding the science that helps us take on these struggles is.

Here at <em>frank</em>, we’re grateful for everyone who’s joined in on creating something great and building our community of public interest communicators: Annie Neimand, our managing editor and research director, who is working with the team to launch our podcast in January. Lauren Griffin, who is our <em>frank</em>ology editor and lead writer. The amazing people at Subject Matter, who stepped up when we found ourselves suddenly without a web designer and whose work you’ll see next week. It’s glorious. Ellen Nodine, who is and has always been the engine in our machine. Bruce Trachtenberg, who continues to edit just about everything that appears on our site. Erin Hart and Kristen Grimm, who are building the best <em>frank</em> program ever. Jacki De Bonis, who makes all the things work better and does so with selfless grace. The 128 students who have already signed up to make <em>frank</em>2016 as magical as ever. Joe Marx and Fred Mann at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, who provide critical advice and funding. Sidney Howard and Dustin Tuliao, who make everything beautiful and interesting. David Morse at Atlantic Philanthropies, whose counsel and network contribute immeasurably. Jasper Fessmann, who has dedicated himself to creating the scholarship that will define this field and who never, ever seems to have a bad day.  Linda Hon, who has taken on creating a new scholarly conference that will advance this field, and who has her eye on creating an academic journal for public interest communications. Rich Neimand, who answers every call for help within moments. The dozens of people who have spoken at <em>frank</em>.  Vince Stehle and Jessica Clark, who have provided critical connections. Extraordinary colleagues like Matt Sheehan and Randy Bennett, and a dean and department chair in Diane McFarlin and Juan Carlos Molleda who offer boundless support. Andy Burness, who continues to look for opportunities to help and keeps the voice and perspective of our deeply missed Frank Karel in every conversation. The students who have studied public interest communications and started careers in this field. And of course, Frank and Betsy Karel who started everything.

There are a hundred more people who belong on this list, which of course is the biggest risk of putting anything like this together. We are only at the beginning of what <em>frank </em>and public interest communications will be. As much as we have to be grateful for, we have even more to do.

Happy Thanksgiving.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/11/29/your_guide_to_the_paris_cop21_climate_change_talks.html">COP21 Paris negotiations</a> on the climate wind up, the world waits to see whether our leaders will take the necessary steps to prevent catastrophic climate change. <a href="http://www.cop21paris.org/about/cop21">COP21</a>, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, aims to achieve a legally binding agreement to keep global warming below 2°C. Climate advocates from around the globe have been taking – and continue to take – extraordinary steps to mobilize in hopes of pressuring political leaders to do the right thing.

Here at <em>frank</em>, we’re rounding up our favorite climate-themed studies in hopes of aiding communicators who are working on campaigns, while<b id="yui_3_16_0_1_1449152595571_2641" class="yiv6513780424"> </b>encouraging others to keep up the fight<b id="yui_3_16_0_1_1449152595571_2641" class="yiv6513780424">.</b>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/meet-the-new-spokespeople-for-climate-change-politicians/">1) Meet the New Spokespeople for Climate Change: Politicians</a>

During the negotiations, we will be hearing from political leaders about the importance and impacts of climate change. Research suggests that these messages matter – in fact, statements about climate change from political leaders play a major role in public opinion on the issue.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-climate-conspiracy-theories-hurt-the-environment/">2) How Climate Conspiracy Theories Hurt the Environment</a>

Speaking of politicians, there’s nothing like a climate summit to bring out the climate denialists and conspiracy theorists. This is bad news for the rest of us, though, because research suggests that exposure to conspiracy theories on the climate can increase peoples’ belief that the whole thing is overblown.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/even-in-lopsided-climate-change-negotiations-both-sides-can-win/">3) Even in Lopsided Climate Change Negotiations, Both Sides Can Win.</a>

Not all regions are motivated by the same messaging. Research suggests that residents of richer countries can be convinced to pay more to prevent climate change as long as they believe that the deal is fair.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/dont-like-the-solution-make-believe-theres-no-problem/http:/frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/how-we-talk-about-climate-change-solutions-matters/">4) Don’t Like the Solution? Make Believe There’s No Problem</a>

Given the highly-politicized nature of the climate conversation in the United States, it’s easy to feel like some sections of the American public will never come around to our obligation to the environment and to the future. But this study suggests that how we talk about the solutions to climate change can move the needle for skeptical groups, making it easier to take action.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/for-action-on-the-climate-keep-your-messages-local/">5) For Action on the Climate, Keep Your Messages Local</a>

For most of us, Paris is distant geographically and the worst impacts of climate change are temporally distant. So how can we motivate people to care about this critical issue when it’s so much easier to tune out distant signals? This study has a possible solution: emphasize the local consequences of doing nothing.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>5 Trends in Nonprofit Marketing &amp; Communications</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s an exciting time for communicators and marketers working within the social impact sector.

As we all know, the world faces complicated and big social issues — hunger, homelessness, environmental degradation and income inequality to name a few. The list goes on and on, and it can seem overwhelming to think about the many issues society faces and question if they will be solved.

But there’s good news.

The social impact sector — nonprofits, socially responsible businesses, social enterprises and the practitioners who work within them — has arguably never been more effective and innovative. Not only are smart communicators and marketers helping to raise awareness about these important issues, but many are also capably persuading target audiences to take tangible actions that support proven social change.

<a href="http://csic.georgetown.edu/">Georgetown University’s Center for Social Impact Communication (CSIC)</a>, a research and action center within the School of Continuing Studies (SCS), works with both students and practitioners to help increase social impact through the power of communicators at the University and beyond.

Through their applied research studies, workshops and classes, they keep their eyes on the exciting trends within the sector. Here are five trends that the CSIC team is currently following:

<strong>Trend One: </strong><strong>The need for more strategic storytelling. </strong>Numbers numb, but stories get stored. Stories create emotional connections with target audiences and smart social impact organizations are firmly on the storytelling bandwagon. With this rise in the amount of storytelling for social impact comes the double-edged sword that traditional techniques are now falling flat. The bar is higher than ever before to create strategic stories that have purpose, interesting characters and a hook that drives people to not just watch but also take an action. Read more about the five essential (and strategic!) elements of an effective story in <a href="http://csic.georgetown.edu/research/storytelling">CSIC’s <em>Stories Worth Telling</em>report</a>.

<strong>Trend Two: </strong><strong>The power of smart imagery. </strong>Images can play a vital role in helping messages reach an audience. Smart imagery drives an emotional connection that words alone cannot achieve. Many social impact organizations are investing in professional, journalistic-style photography as a way to show an authentic side of the change the organization is working to drive. CSIC's <a href="http://csic.georgetown.edu/research/communicating-via-imagery"><em>Communicating Via Imagery</em> study</a> shares lessons on how nonprofit organizations are using photography as part of their communication strategies.

<strong>Trend Three: </strong><strong>The currency of influence. </strong>Nonprofits are – understandably – in a perpetual fundraising mode. But to view current or prospective supports only for their possible monetary donations is a mistake. The social impact sector must remember that social media’s empowerment of the individual means anyone can — and is — an influencer among his or her circle of friends and family. That type of influence is a new, powerful “currency” that shouldn’t be underestimated. CSIC explored this topic in its <a href="http://csic.georgetown.edu/research/digital-persuasion/digital-persuasion"><em>Digital Persuasion</em> study</a>.

<strong>Trend Four: </strong><strong>The synergy of purpose<em> and</em> profit. </strong>Doing well by doing good is not only possible, but it’s also happening at breakneck speed. Through corporate social responsibility and cause marketing programs, corporations are proving that they can create profit while also being a good corporate citizen. There are still many examples of inauthentic green and pink washing out there, but as consumers continue to expect more social impact from the companies they buy from, most companies are responding in innovative, results-oriented ways. Through its <a href="http://csic.georgetown.edu/research/csr-cause-marketing">research</a>, CSIC actively looks at how corporations large and small are bringing together purpose and profit.

<strong>Trend Five: </strong><strong>The rise of the social strategist. </strong>The above trends are not driven by amorphous organizations, but rather by the individuals behind them: the smart communicators and marketers who combine both head and heart to create social impact. Through nearly 60 interviews with expert practitioners representing organizations and companies like Doctors Without Borders, Chipotle and many in between, <em><a href="http://csic.georgetown.edu/research/social-strategist">The Social Strategist Project</a> </em>uncovers insights about the skills and traits necessary to be an impact-driven communicator.

		<title>6 Simple Steps to Understanding Your Audiences Through Research</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2016 is almost here: do you know who your target audiences are—and who they are <em>not</em>?

With many no-or low-cost research tools and resources available today, it can be tempting to dive to data gathering before carefully considering some best approaches to exploring these questions, and many more. As a brand builder, I am always grateful for my earlier career roles in the market research field, where I learned firsthand the importance of getting clear on these questions upfront. For nonprofits, research can offer key insights, and provide a critical filter to help ensure that the marketing, communications, and programming resources you spend are closely aligned with your community’s top needs. Research can also be a powerful tool to help inform strategic planning processes, by helping organizations better define audience segments, vet early stage ideas, and identify new impact opportunities ahead.

As you consider strategies for the coming year, below are some simple best practices to help you better understand and engage the communities you serve:

<strong>1. Pick Your Path: Quantitative or Qualitative?</strong>

There are two key types of research: quantitative and qualitative. Simply put, <strong>Quantitative research </strong>typically determines the ‘who’ and the ‘what,’ and broad response trends among them, through standardized survey questions. <strong>Qualitative research, </strong>on the other hand, explores more of the the ‘how’ and the ‘why’ around the behaviors, attitudes, beliefs, and motivations, that drive the decisions and actions of your target audience. Common qualitative research tools include interviews, focus groups, custom user panels, web usability testing, and ethnographic studies.

While quantitative research is relatively easy and cost-effective to deploy, never underestimate the power of a direct conversation with a member of your target audience. Even if you plan to deploy a survey to collect quantitative data, I recommend incorporating a brief round of qualitative interviews beforehand to help focus and refine your questions; in addition, conducting follow-up conversations after the survey ends can offer critical context to the trends you uncover, and help you further explore any unexpected responses you receive. And, the personal stories and anecdotes gathered through these conversations can also become powerful storytelling tools for your ongoing communications and marketing efforts.

<strong>2. Get Clear on Your Goals</strong>

Research goals vary significantly; likewise, the setup of your survey should be tailored accordingly, based on the specific insights you are seeking. Are you looking to test the waters for new concepts and potential offerings? Gain a better understand of how people perceive your brand? Identify a specific gap in your customer service process?

When drafting your approach, be vigilant about asking <u>why</u> each question matters, and what outcome you hope to achieve with the answers. The Prichard team offers some great survey-building basics in <a href="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/featured-home/5-steps-to-conduct-an-audience-survey/">5 Steps to Conduct an Audience Survey</a>, and SurveyMonkey also offers <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/sample-survey-questionnaire-templates/">many templates</a> as a starting point. And, think about the specific dynamics of how your respondents will be reading your survey; there are many great options to consider. For example, <a href="https://survmetrics.com/?utm_source=zapier&amp;utm_medium=profile&amp;utm_campaign=partnership">Survmetrics</a>specializes photo-powered surveys, and <a href="http://www.loopsurvey.com/?utm_source=zapier&amp;utm_medium=profile&amp;utm_campaign=partnership">LoopSurvey</a> on mobile surveys. For a quick roundup of others to explore, <a href="https://zapier.com/learn/ultimate-guide-to-forms-and-surveys/best-survey-apps/">click here</a>.

<strong>3. Screen: To Focus, and to Filter</strong>

Creating clear screening criteria upfront, for both quantitative and qualitative research, will help ensure that your respondent pool is as targeted as possible; unless you have the resources to analyze and act on data gathered from multiple user segments, consider breaking them into smaller, more discrete projects so you can dig deeper into the questions that matter most to you now. If you are deploying a survey, begin with a series of brief framing questions to filter basic factors such as professional role, geographic location, or length of their relationship with you to help you understand what nuances and trends exist among them. For qualitative research, recruit participants who represent the right mix of perspectives on the topic you are exploring, to ensure that you have a broad spectrum of opinions and experiences to draw from.

<strong>4. Messaging Matters: Keep it Simple</strong>

Be clear and direct about your intentions for the survey, frame your questions in clear and simple language, and consider using <a href="https://www.surveygizmo.com/survey-software-features/logic-branching/">logic and branching</a> to customize the survey experience between users. Also consider the question order; place more complex or potentially sensitive questions towards the middle or end of the survey to avoid deterring participants before they are fully engaged in the process. And, send your survey draft to a few objective individuals to ensure directions are clear, and to confirm that the estimated survey timing is accurate.

<strong>5. Seek Honesty &amp; Avoid Bias</strong>

Impactful research relies on honest feedback. Often, well-intended studies garner disappointing results if research is not carefully constructed with this in mind. In addition, some respondents are cautious about providing constructive or negative feedback to an organization they genuinely care about, for fear of offending someone. If possible, enlist the support of a neutral, third-party resource to support study development and deployment, and offer the option of anonymous feedback. If budget resources don’t allow for this, consider recruiting a skilled volunteer, past Board member, or trusted industry colleague to play this role to help avoid these potential pitfalls.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[For the first time in 17 years and 20 national elections, the Venezuelan opposition overwhelmingly won two-thirds (112/167) of the National Assembly’s seats with a noticeable participation of 75 percent of voters on Sunday, Dec.6, 2015.  The political event is not only, as <i>The New York Times</i> highlights, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/07/world/americas/venezuela-elections.html?emc=edit_th_20151207&amp;nl=todaysheadlines&amp;nlid=71823260&amp;_r=0">rare victory</a>, but also an example of how a political organization circumvented governmental media censorship and control with digital communications technologies.

Winning two-thirds of the National Assembly means that the opposition became a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelas-opposition-says-it-has-supermajority-1449588494">super majority</a> or qualified majority. Opposition lawmakers, therefore, will have the power to dismiss ministers and judges of the Supreme Court (Tribunal Superior de Justicia, TSJ), rectors of the questioned National Electoral Council, and even to request a recall referendum to oust President Nicolas Maduro without collecting a million signatures.

To understand the relevance of this case, some context is needed. Freedom House reports a significant, progressive decline in Venezuelan press freedom since 2003, awarding the country a “not free” status.  <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-press/2014/venezuela">This status</a> resulted from a monopoly of traditional media operations, especially broadcasting, and the enactment of a 2004 Law on Social Responsibility in Radio, Television, and Electronic Media (amended in 2010) for “democratic security” that imposes heavy fines on private media that significantly restricts freedom of expression. Similarly, Reporters Without Borders’ <a href="https://index.rsf.org/#!/index-details/VEN">2015 World Press Freedom Index</a> rates Venezuela #137 out of 180 countries stating that “the country’s economic and social crisis had a disastrous impact on freedom of information.”

The control over airways and print publications are only a symptom of a deteriorated democracy as Venezuela receives very poor reviews in almost every aspect. The 2015 Index of Economic Freedom of the Heritage Foundation ranks Venezuela as <a href="http://www.heritage.org/index/country/venezuela">repressed</a>. Additionally, Transparency International’s 2014 Corruption Perception Index evaluates the South American nation as number 161 out of of 175 countries. That translates into an immensely corrupted political and economic environment.

This is the national context in which elections took place that negatively affected the popularity of the governing party and its candidates. The political opposition organization named “Mesa de la Unidad Democrática” (Democratic Unit Roundtable, Spanish acronym MUD) was predicted to receive the benefits of popular discontent with the critical situation; however, facing an almost total media blackout and a biased electoral commission (four of five members of the National Electoral Council, CNE Spanish acronym, represent the governing party,) Luis Almagro, Organization of American States’ General Secretary, denounced the unfair electoral system of Venezuela in an <a href="http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article44286303.html">18-page protest letter</a> days before the electoral event.

Distressingly, watching and listening to the mainstream media (government controlled or censored) and social media the day of the parliamentarian elections appeared that MUD, its candidates, and its proposals did not exist. Moreover, the picture of the country they presented was remarkably different than what economic and social indicators showed. The National Union of Press Workers’ (Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores de Prensa, SNTP) general secretary, Marcos Ruíz, <a href="http://www.noticierodigital.com/2015/12/sntp-las-pantallas-de-los-medios-tradicionales-no-mostraron-la-realidad-del-6d-al-pais/">explained</a> how the screens of traditional media did not show the country’s reality on December 6. He criticized the bias of the mainstream media in Venezuela and the lack of coverage to the opposition leaders before, during, and after Election Day.

Strategically, MUD announced the solution to the media and information censorship: a comprehensive digital media operation named “Unidad Venezuela” (Venezuelan Unity). The communications program included a multimedia YouTube channel, website (unidadvenezuela.org), Facebook account, Twitter account (@unidadvenezuela), Periscope channel (Unidad), Instagram account, and hashtags #EnVivo, #EnVivoUnidad, #SalaDePrensaUnidad, #ReporteUnidad, all efficiently orchestrated.

I first learned about this communications program through family and friends in Venezuela, as well as through influencers I follow on Twitter. In no particular order, the word spread out rapidly through Miami-based opposition and independent online news media, and soon after through international news agencies stationed in Venezuela.

Venezuelan Unity used a professional visual identity design, and transmitted non-stop programming the day of elections, and post-election analysis after the first official bulleting of the CNE after midnight. The coverage continued over the following days with further analysis and future plans. As of Monday, December 7, the YouTube channel had almost 40,000 subscribers, the Twitter account 628,000 followers, the web streaming of the news room more than 90,000 connections, the Instagram over 24,000 followers, and the Periscope account with 106 followers.

The live transmission via internet channels conducted by experienced journalists and commentators presented interviews with a variety of experts (e.g., political scientists, historians, student leaders, etc.), educative public service announcements on how to vote and to protect the vote at the ballot box, and Periscope reports from prescripts nationwide. They reached out to domestic and international audiences, including the growing diaspora in many world locations, who acted as multipliers of the opposition’s messages. With constant clarifications and rumor-control messages, MUD kept the audience informed on the developments of the electoral process and results.

To primarily maintain the voters and international news media informed, News conferences were hosted about every other hour with the participation of opposition leaders, candidates and international companions, in particular seven ex-presidents of Latin American countries (i.e., Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, and Uruguay).

Aiming to enhance the transparency of the overall elections and the voting process, a phone and online hotline was also made available for the population to denounce irregularities in electoral precincts and their perimeters, in which political propaganda and the action of activists were banned. The reported wrongdoings were then illustrated with colored dots on an interactive map of the country available for public view.

In contrast to the divisive language used by government-control or censored media, the MUD channel contained positive messages to reassure the population that the time for change has arrived, but most importantly that electing a National Assembly was a pivotal step towards rescuing democracy and its institution, not to say improving the lives of Venezuelans.

During the campaign, MUD also used digital communications technologies to circumvent the government hegemony over news and information. By 2014 in Venezuela, according to the International Telecommunication, 57% of the population of 30 million people uses the Internet; however, the service is slow and crashes regularly. The technical difficulties seemed acute during the day of the elections.

In addition to the effective digital communications channels of the opposition, MUD also worked intensively in securing the transparency of the electoral process. <a href="http://www.ventevenezuela.org/">Vente Venezuela</a>, a civil group that supports the political agenda of the opposition, planned and executed a citizens’ mobilization program to protect the integrity of the elections. This program was especially important in the last hours of the process when, in previous electoral processes, the PSUVE with impunity has ridged the votes or coerced citizens to vote for their candidates, sometimes by using violence and intimidation. The plan, named Clear Singing (Plan Canta Claro), took two years in to develop and started by cleaning the voters’ registry then, in the last six months gearing to the December elections, recruiting and training 100,000 citizens to secure more than 4,000 precincts in which irregularities were detected in previous elections where the socialists candidates unexpectedly won with more than 70% of the votes.

The opposition’s victory in Venezuela is commendable and encouraging. Nevertheless, there are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/venezuelas-opposition-shouldnt-celebrate-yet.html?emc=edit_ty_20151208&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=71823260&amp;_r=0">challenges ahead</a> and MUD may need to actively maintain its digital communications channels to circumvent media censorship while trying to rescue the constitutional functions of the National Assembly and tackling the economic and social crisis the population faces. Despite President Maduro’s acceptance of the elections’ results, he blamed an “economic war” waged by the right-wing forces for the defeat of his United Socialist Party (PSUV, Spanish acronym) and went on to say that the real winner was a counterrevolution movement monitored by foreign forces, including the U.S. embassy in Caracas.

The following weeks and months will dictate the need to go back to the elections’ strategy to inform national and international audiences on the advances or obstacles the opposition-controlled National Assembly will face. Raúl Slolk, Venezuelan lawyer and writer, said in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/opinion/venezuelas-opposition-shouldnt-celebrate-yet.html?emc=edit_ty_20151208&amp;nl=opinion&amp;nlid=71823260&amp;_r=0">opinion page</a>, “the opposition-controlled National Assembly may be powerless before its term even begins if the government decides to try to cripple it”. In addition to this potential scenario, among the fewer elected deputies of PSUV are the first lady, Cilia Flores, and Diosdado Cabello, the current president of the National Assembly (Parliament), about whom the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/venezuelan-officials-suspected-of-turning-country-into-global-cocaine-hub-1431977784">international media</a> have reported having alleged ties with cocaine trafficking. The new Parliament will be sworn in on Tuesday, December 5 and a new president of this legislative body will be elected among the new opposition deputies.

The digital communications strategic programming may be needed soon after the newly elected lawmakers take control over Parliament in January. Current head of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, declared on his own television show that he would transfer ownership of the National Assembly’s television and radio stations to the communications professionals who operate them. The move aims to prevent the incoming opposition lawmakers from reformulating the stations’ editorial line, which currently operate as blatant propaganda arms for the socialist party and the Maduro’s regime.]]></content:encoded>

The political event is not only, as The New York Times highlights, a rare victory, but also an example of how a political organization circumvented governmental media censorship and control with digital communications technologies.]]></excerpt:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[2015 has been a big year for movement builders and changemakers. This year will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the most important.

As we make resolutions for 2016, it is important that we reflect on the profound movements of 2015. This list is certainly not exhaustive, but it reminds us of the great work that has been done and inspires us for the work ahead. Here are our three favorite movement moments of 2015:

&nbsp;

<b>1. </b><b>#BlackLivesMatter went from a hashtag to the most defining civil rights movement of the 21st century. </b>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/black_lives_matter.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12717 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/black_lives_matter.jpg" alt="black_lives_matter" width="700" height="435" /></a>

2015 began with the continued unrest following the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Trayvon Martin in 2013 and the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri by a police officer. Following, #Blacklivesmatter – a grassroots hashtag campaign used to shed light on a history of racism and police brutality in this country – spread through social media. In 2015, the deaths of Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, Laquan McDonald and the recent ruling in the death of Tamir Rice propelled #Blacklivesmatter from a hashtag to a full-blown movement.

As a result, systemic racism, police brutality and the criminal justice system are in the national conversation and central to the upcoming election, as the #Blacklivesmatter activists have <a href="http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/4/no-free-pass-for-democratic-candidates-says-black-lives-matter-founder.html">successfully pressured</a> the 2016 presidential candidates to publicly address the issue.

The #Blacklivesmatter has become the leading call for action for racial justice across the United States while demonstrating the power of social media in mobilizing movements and fostering social change.

It has since inspired many other campaigns, including <a href="http://www.aapf.org/sayhernamereport/">#sayhername</a> – a campaign to amplify the stories of black women who have died at the hands of police, <a href="https://www.rt.com/usa/231451-muslim-lives-matter-triple-homicide/">#Muslimlivesmatter </a>– which began trending on social media after the killing of three young Muslims in North Carolina and the growing Islamophobia in the United States and <a href="http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2014/08/_iftheygunnedmedown_shows_how_black_people_are_portrayed_in_mainstream_media.html">#ifiwasgunneddown</a> – a social media campaign to show how black people are stereotyped in mainstream media coverage of police violence.

Who to watch in 2016:

In August 2015, #Blacklivesmatter activists stepped up their political game with the launch of <a href="http://www.joincampaignzero.org/%23vision">Campaign Zero</a>. The campaign calls for policy makers at all levels of government to implement 10 detailed policy solutions for ending police violence in America. These solutions include limiting police interventions, improving community interactions and ensuring accountability. The campaign also publicly measures the 2016 presidential candidates against their policy solutions.

&nbsp;

<b>2. #Lovewins: In a historic 5-4 ruling, the Supreme Court sided with love, ruling bans on marriage equality </b><b>unconstitutional.</b>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lgbt.jpg"><img class="wp-image-12718 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/lgbt.jpg" alt="lgbt" width="731" height="446" /></a>

For more than <a href="http://www.freedomtomarry.org/pages/history-and-timeline-of-marriage">40 years</a>, the LGBT movement has organized for the right to marry, and in June, with <i>Obergefell v. Hodges, </i>the Supreme Court ruled<i> </i>that marriage equality is the law of land.

<a href="https://storify.com/HRC/lovewins">Americans </a>celebrated the win on social media with more than <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/06/were-all-those-rainbow-profile-photos-another-facebook-experiment/397088/">1 million people</a> turning their profile pictures rainbow, and <a href="http://www.people.com/article/barack-obama-michelle-obama-favorite-songs-movies-moments-2015">President Obama</a> called the ruling one of his favorite moments of 2015.

While activists and their allies took a moment to celebrate, they quickly got back to work on important movement issues including <a href="http://www.hrc.org/explore/topic/transgender">transgender rights</a> and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2014/12/10/102804/we-the-people/">work and housing discrimination</a>.

Who to watch:

The Human Rights Campaign – the largest civil rights organization working to achieve equality for LGBT Americans – has been at the forefront of the movement providing news, campaigns, reports and calls to action on the local and national level. On their site they provide resources for issue areas for the LGBT movement.

&nbsp;

<b>3. World leaders shut it down on climate change like a boss</b>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pope-us-flag.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-12719" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/pope-us-flag.jpg" alt="The U.S. flag is seen as Pope Francis greets the crowd during his arrival to lead his general audience in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican March 27. (CNS photo/Paul Haring) (March 27, 2013) See POPE-AUDIENCE March 27, 2013." width="696" height="467" /></a>

2015 was a big year for climate change. In June, Pope Francis delivered his historic <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/how-pope-franciss-not-yet-official-document-on-climate-change-is-already-stirring-controversy/2015/06/17/ef4d46be-14fe-11e5-9518-f9e0a8959f32_story.html">encyclical </a>denouncing the damage humans have done to the environment. He called on policy makers and people of faith to take action on climate change.

“Climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods,” he wrote.

Then, in November, more than 140 world leaders gathered in Paris for two weeks to negotiate an agreement to address the climate crisis. At the gathering, <a href="http://www.cop21paris.org/about/cop21">COP21</a>, also known as the 2015 Paris Climate Conference, world leaders agreed to a legally binding agreement to keep global warming below 2°C and abandon fossil fuels.

Who to watch:

There is a lot of great work being done on the multifaceted issue of climate change. From<a href="http://mediaimpactfunders.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Crafting-High-Impact-Environmental-Media-Wrapup.pdf"> telling stories </a>about climate change, findings ways to <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/use-the-right-moral-message-to-bridge-the-partisan-divide/">communicate across the political aisle</a> to form consensus on climate policy, to creating <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/14/business/climate-accord-draws-mixed-reaction-from-business-leaders.html">a global tax on Carbon pollution,</a> to <a href="http://prospect.org/article/qa-how-slash-emissions-while-creating-jobs">investing in green technologies and jobs</a>, there is much to watch in 2016.

		<title>Why We’re Building Changeville</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/hamilton-meet-the-man-behind-broadways-hip-hop-masterpiece-20150929?page=3">an interview </a>with Rolling Stone about the musical phenomenon <em>Hamilton</em>, Lin-Manuel Miranda describes his moment of insight that hip-hop and the story of the founding fathers are inextricably linked: When a hurricane destroyed Hamilton’s childhood home, he wrote a poem about the storm that was so good that local business leaders agreed to send him to New York for an education.

“The second he writes a poem to get himself off the island, I was like, ‘Well, that’s very hip-hop,’ “ Miranda said. “To literally write verse that gets you out of your circumstances that’s <em>about</em> how terrible your circumstances are, I mean, that’s everyone from Jay Z and Marcy to Lil Wayne writing about Hurricane Katrina. As I was reading the book, all these hip-hop analogies couldn’t help but pop up.”

For as long as people have worked to drive change, music has amplified their efforts, brought new people in, and inspired others. Films and stories create empathy and present fresh perspectives on stereotypes. When music, books, film and comedy accompany movements, change happens.

Social movements have soundtracks.

***

<em>On <span class="aBn" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_1570209486"><span class="aQJ">February 25, 2016</span></span>, we’ll launch <a href="http://changeville.us">Changeville</a>, a film, music, comedy and virtual reality festival that connects artists, storytellers, comedians and movement builders. Set among the coffee shops, music venues and tech companies that define Gainesville, Florida’s downtown, Changeville draws on the energy and innovation of the city’s growing technology and media culture. Screenings, exhibits and shows are open to all moviegoers and music lovers.</em>

<em>This music and storytelling festival is the intersection where passionate filmmakers, digital media innovators and musicians cross paths with professionals who build movements and drive positive social change.</em>

***

What if people determined to use their art to drive change had a place to connect with others who believe as fervently as they do that their songs and stories can make a difference? And what if they could also connect with funders who invest in these efforts, strategists who focus on calls to action and scholars who invest their efforts in generating new knowledge that can make change happen and bring more people to the table?

In the classes I teach in public interest communications at the University of Florida, I teach my students to focus their communications efforts on the smallest possible audiences, those whose change in behavior or reversal of decision will create the change they seek. Do we need more gender-neutral restrooms for transgendered students? Go to the folks at physical plant who approve building and maintenance plans. That kind of focused thinking is critical to making the most of the always too-meager resources available to drive change.

But in the face of persistent racism, deeply entrenched intolerance of same-sex couples or continued global warming, we require a cultural movement. While policy might make it illegal for a bank to withhold a loan from a family of color moving into a white neighborhood, only cultural change will ensure that that family is welcomed with enough warmth that they encourage other friends to move there too.

There are plenty of successes that show that when pop culture and social change objectives connect, changes move from the fringes of society to the mainstream. For example, the concept of the designated driver quickly gained traction in the 1980s when writers from two popular sit-coms wrote the idea into their script. In a matter of months, the concept was firmly entrenched in Americans’ minds, along with a significant drop in deaths associated with drunken driving.

More recently, Sea World’s stock value plummeted when the compelling stories behind the animals in their parks came to light through the documentary Blackfish.

And just as Billy Holiday’s Strange Fruit shined a light on tragedy of lynchings and Nina Simone’s haunting voice inspired and connected the civil rights movement, Kendrick Lamar has become the soundtrack of Black Lives Matter.

This year’s Changeville is just the beginning of what we hope will become a vibrant creative community among those using their art and storytelling abilities to drive change, while also creating a shared destination for those who create and appreciate this kind of work. We’re hosting it against the backdrop of two conferences that bring together many of the communities instrumental to creating change. The first is <em><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016/">frank</a></em>, a gathering that brings together movement builders from throughout the world to connect and share the best of what they know, the second is <a href="http://journalisminteractive.com/2016/">Journalism Interactive</a>, which connects the foremost educators in digital journalism and industry leaders.

We’re starting Changeville modestly with a handful of great bands, including the <a href="http://www.mountain-goats.com">Mountain Goats </a>and <a href="http://www.hurrayfortheriffraff.com">Hooray for the Riffraff</a>, and finding Gainesville bands who share their passion for using music to drive change. We’ll bring in films that use stories to drive change, and virtual reality creators who are using this format to create empathy and transport those who experience their work to new environments. And finally, we’ll bring in comedians who use their work to comment on social and racial justice.

It’s our hope that Changeville will grow over the years, and that Gainesville will become as much of a destination for people of purpose as Austin is for the tech world.

You can buy tickets for Changeville <a href="http://changeville.us/#tickets" target="_blank">here</a>. And, if you’re an artist who sees your work in this idea, we’d love to see you in Changeville. <a href="http://changeville.us/#play-with-us" target="_blank">Drop us a line</a>.

Early bird tickets are $25 until January 30. Following, tickets will be $29. The week of Changeville, tickets will be $35.

<em>Changeville is hosted by the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications with support from local businesses.</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>We Just Built the Best frank Ever</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hard to believe, but the <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016/"><em>frank</em> gathering</a> will turn three this February, and it’s growing up.

Last year, we brought you Steven Pinker, <a href="https://vimeo.com/120628765">Sheryl WuDunn </a>and <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-2015/2015-speakers/">other luminaries</a> who have become famous in our sector. They were funny and inspiring and guess what? Not your favorite speakers. When we looked at the evaluations, you told us that your favorite speakers were people who shared their perspectives from the front lines of change. They were the people who you hadn’t heard of. They weren’t famous, but they were building and leading movements that were creating real change.

We took that to heart and looked for more people who are in the fight every day and winning on the issues that matter most. People like Brian Sheehan, who led the fight for marriage equality in Ireland. We have some luminaries, like storytelling guru Andy Goodman; Eileen Boone, who made the courageous decision to pull tobacco products from CVS stores, and Molly Crabapple, whose stunning book “Drawing Blood” about her work as an artist drawing change is lighting up Amazon.

But you may not have heard of scholar Paul Slovic, whose research offers new insight to the power of stories and empathy, or Bryan Boyer, who is developing a “carebot” for NPR that will measure how people respond to stories and act on what they read or hear. Or Naomi Ekperigan, whose scathing comedy brings to light racial and gender inequality.

We also added some new things we think you’ll love. Each of our blocks of speakers will be followed by scrums. These are opportunities for you to sit down with the speakers and other participants over a cup of coffee and share ideas.

One of the things that we think a lot about is how to send you home with a whole new group of friends who care as much about change as you do. At <em>frank</em>, you’ll have the opportunity to connect easily with nearly every single participant. We’ll do that two ways:
<ol>
	<li>You’ll be part of a 20-person Krewe who we’ll introduce you to before your pilgrimage to Gainesville. Your Krewe will be your tribe while you’re at <em>frank </em>— friendly faces at the happy hours, someone to sit and reflect with and people to compete with against the other Krewes. If you’re registered for <em>frank</em>, you’ll hear more about Krewes in the coming month.</li>
	<li>A massively fun progressive dinner. On Wednesday, you’ll be having dinner at not one downtown restaurant, but three. During each dinner course, you’ll sit down with a different group of <em>frank</em>sters. We’ll all meet up for dessert and an epic lip-sync contest to compare notes.</li>
</ol>
We’ve also added a music, film, virtual reality and comedy festival called “Changeville” that will unfold Thursday, Feb. 25 after a street fair in the downtown plaza featuring Rolling Stone’s performer of the year, <a href="http://www.thecharlesbradley.com">Charles Bradley</a>. If you’re registered for <em>frank</em>, you can <a href="http://changeville.us/#tickets">buy your ticket</a> for Changeville at a big discount. Read more about Changeville <a href="http://changeville.us/#about">here.</a>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i>It feels like Christmas all over again here at frank. One of our phenomenal speakers, public interest communications guru <strong>Andy Goodman</strong>, has </i><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/freerange_2016_01.pdf"><i>called on</i></a><i> his tribe of do-gooders, storytellers, communication aficionados and people who want to make an impact, to join us at frank2016.</i>

<i>Andy is the founder of </i><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com."><i>the Goodman Center</i></a><i>, a company with the mission to help good causes reach more people with more impact. The center has worked with some of the top foundations including Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Ford Foundation, MacArthur Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Andy has published many books and periodicals, including must reads </i><i>such as </i><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com/resources/"><i>Storytelling as Best Practice</i></a><i>, </i><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com/resources/"><i>Why Bad Ads Happen to Good Causes</i></a><i> and </i><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com/resources/"><i>Why Bad Presentations Happen to Good Causes</i></a><i>.</i>

<i>Eric Schwarz, president of </i><a href="http://www.citizenschools.org"><i>Citizen Schools</i></a><i> says “Andy Goodman makes marketing fun! He cuts through the gobbledygook and teaches nonprofit leaders how to tell their stories better. Andy helped Citizen Schools discover our essence and communicate more powerfully, leading to more growth and impact.”</i>

<i>Chip Heath, Co-author of </i><a href="http://heathbrothers.com/books/made-to-stick/"><i>Made To Stick</i></a><i> says “Every nonprofit I know has had Andy Goodman give one of his famous storytelling workshops or wants to have him give one. As a result he’s accumulated more frequent-flyer miles than the head of the International Olympic committee. I’m thrilled to hear he’s figured out a way to increase supply to match demand without having to spend more time in airports. Every worthy cause would benefit from one of his message workshops.”</i>

<i>Lawrence Bender, Producer of An Inconvenient Truth says “I was already comfortable at the front of a room, but in just a couple of hours, Andy helped me think differently about the craft of presenting, and I know we walked away better presenters for it.”</i>

<i>We told you he is wonderful. We can’t wait for Andy to share his insights at frank2016. To learn more about his work, check out  </i><a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com/"><i>www.thegoodmancenter.com</i></a><i>. Read below Andy’s call to build our tribe.</i>

Do you use strategic communications to drive social change? Some of the smartest people who do will be gathering at the University of Florida from February 23-26 to compare notes on what's working, what's not, and what may be worth trying in the coming year. If you're a regular reader of this newsletter, you should probably be there, too. The <em>frank</em> conference, now in its third year, is a unique gathering of community builders and change-makers that ranks among the most informative, entertaining and inspiring events you can attend – but a trip to Gainesville is by invitation only. To see if <em>frank</em>2016 is right for you (and vice versa), read on.

First, be advised that <em>frank</em> isn't your typical conference with long keynote speeches, endless panels, and lots of experts talking at you. Each day is neatly divided with time for fast-paced talks by strategists, storytellers and scientists as well as casual opportunities to connect with other sophisticated communicators over coffee or cocktails.

You'll have a chance to hear talks by (and rub shoulders with) Eileen Boone, who courageously decided to pull tobacco products from CVS stores; Molly Crabapple, whose book "Drawing Blood" about her work as an artist drawing change is lighting up Amazon; Paul Slovic, whose research offers new insight into the power of stories and empathy; and Bryan Boyer, who is developing a "carebot" for NPR that will measure how people respond to stories and act on what they read or hear.

You'll also become part of an instant community. Every attendee at frank is assigned to a "krewe" – a 20-person team who will become your own local tribe. The conference organizers will introduce you to your krewe before you arrive so even if you don't know a soul who's registered, you'll have a team on-site looking for you. Your krewe will organize events and compete against other krewes throughout the gathering and compete for the coveted Krewe Trophy.

There will also be plenty of fun throughout, including a progressive dinner, an epic lip-sync contest, and regular bursts of poetry from the Get Lit players. The conference organizers have also added a music, film, virtual reality and comedy festival called "Changeville" that will unfold Thursday, February 25 after a street fair in the downtown plaza featuring Rolling Stone magazine's performer of the year, Charles Bradley.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><b>How politics shape us, what zombies teach us and how stories affect our actions.</b></h2>
<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love the new year, and not just because I get to start planning my outfits for the upcoming </span></i><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank gathering.</span></i></a>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">As one of frank’s resident research nerds, I anxiously wait for January when I, along with a team of practitioners and scholars, get to read through all of the amazing submissions to our</span></i><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/prize/"> <i><span style="font-weight: 400;">annual prize for research in public interest communications</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Each year, we award one $10,000 and two $1,500 prizes to peer-reviewed research that contributes to effective </span></i><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/what-is-public-interest-communications/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">public interest communications</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> practice and that continues to build the academic field. </span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, we had our biggest pool of submissions from a </span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">broad range of psychologists, political scientists, sociologists and communications scholars.</span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The three finalists will present their research at the frank gathering in front of an audience of practitioners, artists, activists, researchers and professionals who will vote for the $10,000 winner.</span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Read about</span></i><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2016 research in public interest in communications finalists below:</span></i>

<a href="http://troyhcampbell.weebly.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troy Campbell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University and assistant professor in marketing at the University of Oregon. He studies how political ideology and identity shapes people’s beliefs and consumer behavior. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the paper, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solution Aversion: On the Relation Between Ideology and Motivated Disbelief, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell and his colleague Dr. Aaron Kay found that people are more likely to be skeptical of gun control and climate science if they have an aversion to the proposed policy solutions.  According to their research, solution aversion is linked to individual’s political ideology and identity. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell’s research has been featured in</span><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/11/solutions-shape-factual-belief/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Wired</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and</span><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-people-fly-from-facts/"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientific American</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<a href="http://reedcollegeofmedia.wvu.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/julia-fraustino"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Julia Fraustino</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an award winning media and communications scholar. She recently took a position with West Virginia University Reed College of Media teaching courses in strategic communication campaigns, social media strategy, public communication campaigns, social networking and risk communication and ethics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the study, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">CDC's Use of Social Media and Humor in a Risk Campaign – "Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Fraustino and her colleague </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Liang Ma </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">examine the effectiveness of humor in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “zombie apocalypse” emergency preparedness campaign. The campaign was successful in generating buzz and raising awareness, but unsuccessful in boosting emergency preparedness behaviors. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">This research considers the questions of what can be done when the strategies that use emotions – like humor – to grab widespread attention simultaneously reduce intentions to take actions.</span>

<a href="http://niederdeppe.comm.cornell.edu"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Jeff Niederdeppe</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an associate professor in the Department of Communications at the Cornell University. He is a prolific writer whose research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, United States Department of Agriculture and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Niederdeppe studies the effects of mass media campaigns, strategic health messages and news coverage in shaping health behavior, health disparities and social policy. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his study, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inoculation and Narrative Strategies in Competitive Framing of Three Health Policy Issues, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Niederdeppe compares the effectiveness of inoculation messages — those that warn people that others will attempt to persuade them and refute anticipated opposing arguments — and narrative messages — those that personalize policy issues through storytelling — in shaping support for policies designed to reduce obesity, cigarette use and prescription painkiller addiction.</span>

		<title>A New Kind of Academic Conference</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathered in the basement of the UF College of Journalism and Communications, a group of 30 public interest communicators came together in October 2013 with a mission. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal: </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Build a community of people using communications to drive change.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution: </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank.</span></i></a>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about creating the things we wish existed. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We thought it would awesome to have an annual gathering where people of purpose could convene to connect and learn from each other, so we established the </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gathering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We said it would be a game changer to have accessible summaries of peer-reviewed research on strategic communications, so we launched </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We wanted to grow an academic discipline around public interest communications, so we designed classes.  </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We decided that we wanted to turn Gainesville into the destination for changemakers and movement builders, so we built </span><a href="http://changeville.us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changeville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a new storytelling festival that will take place during the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 gathering. At Changeville, we’ll celebrate artists who use their music, art, film and comedy to drive change.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating the things we wish existed is our M.O.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Well this year, we thought “wouldn’t it be amazing to bring together the leading scholars from multiple disciplines to collaborate on research projects to drive change?”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, we created</span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/scholar/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Scholar, 2016). </span></a>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Scholar, 2016) is a one-day academic conference that brings together top researchers from various academic disciplines to collaboratively cultivate research that ignites lasting behavioral, institutional and social change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scholars determined to use their research to create a better world will come to the University of Florida for the first-ever academic conference for public interest communications. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Scholar, 2016) represents a step toward establishing the robust practice area of public interest communications as a unique academic discipline and building the connection between research and practice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We knew we couldn’t build this conference alone, so we enlisted a few of our favorite scholars to serve as the first chairs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These three chairs will lead conversations among our 25 invited scholars in three sessions designed to facilitate collaboration.</span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our sessions themes:</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">1) How can we best communicate for the public good?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">2) How to create and maintain social movements in the public interest? </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">3) How can we overcome societal/structural constraints to achieve public interest goals? </span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <em>frank</em> (Scholars, 2016):</span></h3>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[From public health to the front lines of the feminist, climate justice and #blacklivesmatter movements, these five scholars are driving change with their work.
<h2>5 Black Scholars You Need to Know</h2>
<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/alexander.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-13572 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/alexander.jpg" alt="new jim crow racism scholar " width="1024" height="683" /></a>
<h3><a href="http://newjimcrow.com/about-the-author"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michelle Alexander</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racism and the Criminal Justice System</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Associate professor of law at Ohio State University and civil rights advocate and writer Michelle Alexander is best known for her book </span><em><a href="http://newjimcrow.com/about"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>.</em> Alexander is a scholar often cited in efforts by the #Blacklivesmatter movement.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In her book, she suggests that racism within the U.S. criminal justice system and other governmental policies are</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a continuation of historic racial discrimination. Alexander argues that the U.S. War on Drugs policy and its enforcement has had a consequential impact on the black community, creating a system of racial control similar to how Jim Crow once operated.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">“Race plays a major role-indeed, a defining role – in the current system, but not because of what is commonly understood as old-fashioned, hostile bigotry. This system of control depends far more on racial indifference (defined as a lack of compassion and caring about race and racial groups) than racial hostility – a feature it actually shares with its predecessors,” Alexander said.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a civil rights advocate, Alexander has served as the director of the Racial Justice Project at the ACLU of Northern California, where she lead a national campaign against police use of racial profiling. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alexander also directed the Civil Rights Clinic at Stanford Law School, and she worked as a law clerk in the U. S. Supreme Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Alexander specialized in plaintiff-side class action suits of race and gender discrimination.</span>

<h3><a href="http://drrobertbullard.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robert Bullard
</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Environmental Justice</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have been following the recent Flint water crisis and the climate justice movement in general, you have probably come across the insights of Dr. Robert Bullard. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullard, often described as the </span><a href="http://grist.org/article/dicum/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">father of environmental justice</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> research and activism, has written extensively on sustainable development, environmental racism, community reinvestment, climate justice and regional equity, among many other topics.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the last 30 plus years, Bullard has provided expert testimony in more than 100 civil rights lawsuits. He has won multiple awards including the National Wildlife Federation Conservation Achievement Award in Science, the Sierra Club John Muir Award and the American Bar Association 2015 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Award for Excellence in Environmental Energy and Resources Stewardship</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. In 2014, the Sierra Club named its new Environmental Justice Award after him. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bullard has written many</span><a href="http://drrobertbullard.com/books/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> books</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on the intersections of racism, the environment and social justice. His book, </span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dumping-In-Dixie-Environmental-Quality/dp/0813367921"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class and Environmental Quality</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is now a go-to textbook on the environmental justice field. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this book, Bullard argues that "To be poor, working-class, or a person of color in the United States often means bearing a disproportionate share of the country’s environmental problems." In the book, Bullard follows five black communities engaged in climate justice work and writes about new developments in the environmental justice movement, including organizing strategies and success stories.</span>

<h3><a href="http://womens-studies.rutgers.edu/faculty/core-faculty/66-the-faculty/core-faculty/572-cooper-brittney"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brittney Cooper
</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race, Feminism &amp; Pop Culture</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the feminist powerhouses churning out cultural commentary on U.S. pop culture and politics is Dr. Brittney Cooper, assistant professor of women’s and gender studies and Africana studies at Rutgers University. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Cooper writes on race, feminism and pop culture. She has a weekly column at Salon.com, and her work has been featured at the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ebony.com</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, MSNBC’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Melissa Harris-Perry Show </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Al-Jazeera America</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For two years in a row, Root.com has listed her as a top black influencer. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In her forthcoming book, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Race Women: Gender and the Making of a Black Public Intellectual Tradition, </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">she chronicles the history of black women’s leadership in the U.S. with the goal to ignite conversation around black feminism.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">She also co-founded the popular feminist blog, </span><a href="http://www.crunkfeministcollective.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crunk Feminist Collective</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the mission to “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">create a space of support and camaraderie for hip hop generation feminists of color, queer and straight, in the academy and without, by building a rhetorical community, in which we can discuss our ideas, express our crunk feminist selves,  fellowship with one another, debate and challenge one another, and support each other, as we struggle together to articulate our feminist goals, ideas, visions, and dreams in ways that are both personally and professionally beneficial.”</span>

<h3><a href="http://www.drcarlhart.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carl Hart
</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug Use and Policy</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Carl Hart is a cutting-edge neurologist and the first tenured black professor of sciences at Columbia University. Hart studies the dynamic between recreational drugs </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">and the neurobiological and environmental factors that impact human behavior and physiology.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hart is a member of the National Advisory Council on Drug Abuse and a scientist in the Division of Substance Abuse at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. His work has been featured in both academic and editorial publication around the world, including the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times, The Guardian,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O’ Global</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He has won multiple awards and millions of dollars in grants for his work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his book, </span><em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Price-Neuroscientists-Self-Discovery-Challenges/dp/0062015893/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1454517050&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=9780062015891"><span style="font-weight: 400;">High Price: A Neuroscientist's Journey of Self-Discovery That Challenges Everything You Know About Drugs and Society</span></a></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Hart writes about his experience growing up in one of the toughest neighborhoods in Miami and his mission to redefine addiction through science. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In </span><a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2014/1/6/drugs_arent_the_problem_neuroscientist_carl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an interview</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with <em>Democracy Now</em>, Hart argues “People get addicted for a wide range of reasons. Some people have co-occurring or other psychiatric illnesses that contribute to their drug addiction. Other people get addicted because that’s the best option available to them; other people because they had limited skills in terms of responsibility skills. People become addicted for a wide range of reasons. If we were really concerned about drug addiction, we would be trying to figure out precisely why each individual became addicted. But that’s not what we’re really interested in. We are interested, in this society, of vilifying a drug. In that way, we don’t have to deal with the complex issues for why people really become addicted.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hart works to bring together communities and government officials to develop effective drug policies and treatments and transform public discussion of drug addiction and use.</span>

<h3><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/david-williams/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">David R. Williams
</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">Racism as a Public Health Issue</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. David R. Williams is a professor of public health at the Harvard School of Public Health and professor of African and African American studies and of sociology at Harvard University. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As a world-renowned scholar, he has published more than 300 academic papers in leading journals on the dynamics between racism, class inequality, stress, health behaviors and health outcomes. He created the The Everyday Discrimination scale that is one of the most widely used tools to assess perceived discrimination in health studies. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In his work, he argues that race and class are critical factors that shape people’s health, as they produce health and life expectancy disparities among poor people and people of color. As a result, he suggests that racism and economic inequality should be treated as public health issues. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">On top of all his awards and honors, Williams is one of the top 10 most cited researchers in the social sciences and is considered one of the world’s most influential scientific minds. He was also named as one of the top black thinkers in Healthcare by Johns Hopkins Center for Health Disparities Solutions.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Williams has been involved in the development of health policy at the national level in the U.S. and has worked closely with the Department of Health and Human Services, various academic associations, the MacArthur Foundation’s Research Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health, and he served as the staff director for the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s initiative to Build a Healthier America. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">He has been featured on </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ABC’s Evening News, CNN, PBS, the Katie Couric Show, Al Jazeera, C-SPAN and the Discovery Channel, as well as the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">New York Times</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Time, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Newsweek</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wall Street Journal</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Washington Post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Essence, Jet and USA Today. </span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Author’s note: I know, how is this a real person?)</span></i>
<p style="text-align: center;">~~</p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">This month we will continue to cover leading black thinkers, artists and activists who are changing the world through their work.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tell us, who you think belongs on this list?</span>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/960.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-13697" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/960.jpg" alt="960" width="960" height="540" /></a></h3>
<h3><strong><a href="http://www.tlynnfaz.com">Tatyana Fazlalizadeh</a>
Visual Artist
</strong>Street Harassment</h3>
Artist and activist, Tatyana Fazlalizadeh is a leading voice in the feminist movement. Primarily an oil painter and illustrator, she gained notoriety with her poster campaign “<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/361036/stop-telling-women-not-to-smile/?utm_source=SFFB">Stop Telling Women to Smile</a>.”

For her campaign, Fazlalizadeh conducts interviews with women about their experiences with street harassment, and then paints their portrait. She then makes copies of the women’s portraits accompanied by quotes on their experience. These posters are plastered around the city as means for victims to fight back against their harassers and transform culture.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-13696" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/art2j.jpg" alt="art2j" width="960" height="524" />

Prolific in her work, Tatyana strives to end sexism wherever she sees it.

“I had to be actively and boldly doing something to help push gender equality,” Fazlalizadeh said. “That could be simply calling out sexist comments, jokes, or microaggressions when you hear them. It could mean taking steps within your personal life to reject sexist norms. It could mean creating an art project to tackle the ways women are sexualized and mistreated in public spaces. For me, it meant beginning to do all of those things.”

Originally confined to Tatyana’s neighborhood of Brooklyn, the campaign has since spread across the United States with the mission to empower all women who may feel uncomfortable or unsafe.

<h3><a href="http://tituskaphar.blogspot.com">Titus Kaphar</a>
Visual Artist
Institutionalized Racism</h3>
Titus Kaphar, a visual artist, rose to prominence after the recent riots in Ferguson. In his work, he comments on police brutality, the cycle of prison that many black men face and the perceptions of race within society.

In a recent series <a href="http://www.jackshainman.com/exhibitions/past/2015/past2015kaphar_asphaltandchalk/"><em>Asphalt and Chalk</em></a><em>, </em>Kaphur painted portraits of victims of police brutality, overlaying their faces on top of one another to produce jarring images representative of the pain felt by the black community.

In another series, <a href="http://www.studiomuseum.org/exhibition/titus-kaphar-the-jerome-project"><em>The Jerome Project</em></a>, he used images of black men in prison with the same name as his father, who were also serving time. He placed these images on gold backgrounds covered in tar and gold leaves to represent the time they’ve spent incarcerated while creating a saint-like portrait. In each, their mouths are covered to represent their silence and the tar represents keeping them trapped in a perpetual cycle of imprisonment.
<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube id="9DPVzkAxCAw" align="center" mode="normal"]</p>
Kaphar's work has been featured in<em><a href="http://www.artinamericamagazine.com/news-features/news/-history-in-the-making-titus-kaphar-cuts-up-to-rebuild-/"> Art in America</a></em>, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/11/arts/design/11muse.html?ex=1344484800&amp;en=dfb6e03095f089ae&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;_r=0">New York Times</a> <a href="http://observer.com/2015/01/titus-kaphar-talks-criminal-justice-his-time-painting-and-first-show-at-jack-shainman/">and The Observer</a>. He was named by <a href="http://time.com/time-person-of-the-year-ferguson-painting/">TIME</a> the 2014 Person of the Year for his work on Ferguson. He recently finished a residency at the<a href="http://www.studiomuseum.org"> Studio Museum in Harlem</a>.<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-10-at-10.57.40-AM.png">

<h3><a href="http://phoeberobinson.tumblr.com">Phoebe Robinson</a>
Comedian
Race and Gender</h3>
Robinson is a stand-up comedian who skillfully weaves in social commentary into her work. In her well known blog, <em><a href="http://blaria.com">Blaria</a> </em>(Black Daria, named after the American animated television series), she shares her thoughts on topics such as feminism, the #Blacklivesmatter movement and her experiences as a black woman in general in a tone that is equal parts blithe and sarcastic.

The online magazine, <em>Serial Optimist</em>, said she “is brilliant and able to critique some really complex concepts in a sentence or two. Bask in it, people.”

Robinson is a consultant for the Comedy Central show <em>Broad City</em> and writes for MTV’s <em>Girl Code. </em>Many of her articles have appeared in publications such as the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>The Huffington Post</em>.

She’s appeared on Flavorwire’s list of “25 Female Comedians Everyone Should Know” and one of 12 emerging comics in SF Sketchfest’s “Next Wave of Stand-Up Comedy Stars” series. Huffington Post named her one of “18 Funny Women You Should Be Following On Twitter.”
<p style="text-align: center;">[youtube id="otX1ELoqfGo" align="center" mode="normal"]</p>
Robinson works to create a space for women of color in comedy. In reference to underrepresentation of women of color in comedy writing rooms, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jessica-williams-and-phoebe-robinson-want-comedy-to-stop-ignoring-black-women_us_56094683e4b0af3706dcca22">Robinson said</a>, “It’s ridiculous I’m the only one, because I know 3,500 hilarious women of color that you’re ignoring. So I’m going to do my best to try and bring them along with me or represent for a range of colors.”

<h3><a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/danez-smith">Danez Smith</a>
Poet
Transforming Art</h3>
Danez Smith is a poet who delivers social commentary on a variety of issues, most notably on the prejudice against anything outside of what he describes as the “white, Christian, male, and/or female aesthetic or form.”

In his poems and spoken word performances, Smith highlights a variety of issues including racial injustice in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSp4v294xog">Dear White America</a>,” and the violence against trans-individuals in “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CEJ_ahg7x48">Genesissy</a>” which can be found in his book <a href="http://yesyesbooks.com/store/book/0000023/"><em>[Insert] Boy</em></a>.

In his “<a href="http://donshare.blogspot.com/2014/11/open-letter-to-white-poets-from-danez.html">Open Letter to White Poets</a>,” he calls for white poets to broaden the mind of their audiences and to be the “new guard” against prejudice and injustice.

“We write in an art form that has so much potential to impact change. If we don’t live up to that, we’re really doing ourselves and our genre a discredit.” Smith says. “For me, it’s about talking about the injustices that go on in our country so effortlessly and systematically.”

His talent has earned him several awards including the Lambda Literary Award, fellowships from the McKnight Foundation, Cave Canem and Voices of Our Nation (VONA).

He is a 2011 Individual World Poetry Slam finalist and two-time champion of the Rustbelt Individual.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Zach Schlein and Riyana Lalani

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Bradley’s return to Gainesville has been a long time in the making. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley will take the stage Thursday, Feb. 25 at</span> the<em> </em><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016-community-street-fair/"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 Community Street Fair</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. His performance will reopen the Bo Diddley Plaza, a Gainesville community staple. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Before garnering acclaim as a musician, Bradley spent years </span>on the East coast<span style="font-weight: 400;">, weathering through decades of poverty and racism. Channeling his experiences into messages of love and understanding through his soulful, honest crooning, he has found success in revitalizing soul for mainstream audiences.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Bradley took the time to speak with us about his childhood, his vision for a better world and his hopes to inspire audiences through his music.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Will this be your first show back in Gainesville since your career took off?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Charles Bradley: Yes, and that’s where I was born.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What, if anything, do you remember about Gainesville?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: When I was a child, it was segregated,</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">and I couldn’t go across a fence to certain parts of Gainesville. Where they built the hospital – back in the day – that was my grandmother’s property, and I remember that we couldn’t go out of that zone to go to another zone.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I used to sneak [into] the other part because this guy used to take me over. I remember when he first showed me a TV. I’d never seen a TV in my life, and I was about 6, 7 years old. I used to wonder how people got into the television screen, and he used to laugh at me and tell me all about TV.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">No one ever knew I was going over there – not even my grandmother. The man would say, “don’t never tell nobody that you was coming over here ‘cause they cause trouble.” So I never told nobody until I came to live with my mom [in Brooklyn]. She said,“son, you are a very brave little guy,” and I said, “Mom, he was a good man.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn’t know what racial violence was about until later in my life – not until Martin Luther King Jr. came up. I’d always thought peoples was peoples, a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">nd that’s why, even though I have friends and some family members that still have these hostile feelings inside them, I say, “If you use your love very strongly and show the world that you’re going to change for the better of yourself, then this world will be a better place for all of us to live in.”</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Is it surreal to be headlining a city-wide event in your city of birth? Does it feel like a vindication at all?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: It’s an honor ‘cause that’s where I was born. I have one of my oldest brothers living in Gainesville, and he called me and said, “Charles is it true? Are you coming to Florida?” And I said yes. He says, “I’m gonna go tell everybody that I know in Florida that my brother’s gonna be here.” So it’s gonna be an honor going down there, and I think we’re gonna have a packed house because everybody is looking forward to me coming down there.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Us included. As someone who has faced so much, what do you have to say to young people that are struggling to find the strength to better themselves?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: Don’t let these things like cell phones control you. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find the love in you and be the person that you want to be.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> And all over the land, people will learn to love you – to see that you are not in this world for corruption reasons, you’re in here trying to make peace.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>And that’s the message you want to communicate through your music?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: Yes, to all creations.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Music obviously played a substantial role in seeing you through the most difficult parts of your life. What was it exactly about music that gave you such perseverance and strength?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: Back in the day, I was afraid to speak out. W</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen I get music behind me, it feels like I can soothe the hurt</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and put it in vocals and say it to the room the way I feel it. Because as I was coming up, I was going through a lot of hatred and pain. I didn’t know how to say it, and I was scared if I stood up, I’d get hurt or somebody’s gonna do something to me. So, I find </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">if I put it in music, then everybody wants to hear it.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Having read several interviews with you, and from this discussion as well, would it be fair to say overcoming prejudice and discrimination is a social cause that speaks to you?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: It’s scary<strong>…</strong> I see so much of that every time I turn the news on and watch TV<strong>...</strong> it scares me and it hurts me. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’m asking myself a lot, “what can I do to make a change.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I try to do the best I can in my lyrics to give to the world the chance to make a change, but it’s scary. All I can say is that I hope that I can find better knowledge, wisdom inside of me – that I can try my best and do the best I know as a human being to make this world a better place.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve got to learn how to not look at creed or color. Look at how beautiful a bouquet of roses looks like – different color roses, all look beautiful. We have to learn how to let our beauty of the color of our roses shine to the world.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>You’re well known for your audience interaction, such as jumping into crowds and hugging fans. This is distinctive since many artists are content to just stand on stage and play; What effect do you hope to have on listeners by engaging with them so directly?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: Sometimes I go out into the audience, and I hug them, and I look at them, and I look into the expression of their face. Like my mama always said [and] my grandmama said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look a person straight in the eyes, and you should see everything that they’ve done.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One lady when I went out to the audience one time, she was pregnant. She said, “Charles, I know that you just a human. Will you please bless my baby for me?" And I said, “Oh, my God.” So I got on my knees, and I touched her tummy. I said, “This is gonna be a leader. They’re gonna help this world be a better place,” and she hugged me. Then this other guy came to me, and I looked at him and hugged him. He said, “I just had to get to the front of the line just to see you. I want to show you what I did.” And I went out there, and he pulls his sleeve up, and he shows me his arm. He had my picture tattooed on his arm! I said, “God, Jesus, this is incredible. Young man, come on!” He says, “Charles Bradley, we love you, we love you so much.” And you know that’s what makes me want to keep going and changing and giving and giving.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>What type of musical legacy do you want to leave yourself?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to leave anything that will help humanity. I want to leave a legacy of myself that the world can say, “Charles Bradley was a real person. He loved what he did, and he loved to entertain people, and he liked to give the best.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I like to see the joy in people's’ faces.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I like to see when they actually question that I’m not afraid to answer and give them my respect and honesty with what I have to say to them. I wanna be sharp. I want to reach out to the world and let the world know what’s good. If anybody wants to just hear my album, they can go buy the album. But </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">when I’m live, I want to be LIVE</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And my spirit gets into it, and I tell the guys, “break it down. Let me get with the public. Let me start a feeling.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You gotta think about being on the stage and really wanna shine and give these people what they want. Some of them spend their hard earned money with the little pennies that they make, but they want to come out and see me? I wanna give them a show. I don’t want them coming out and saying, “Aw, he was this.” I want people to tell, “You got to go see Charles Bradley.” </span>

&nbsp;

<b>One last question: Since you performed for years as a James Brown impersonator under the pseudonym “Black Velvet,” what is your favorite James Brown song?
</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB: My favorite James Brown song is “Lonesome One.” “Lonesome One” will always be my favorite because it’s my mom’s favorite song. Now if you ask me about my favorite sad song, it’s one of those songs that’s got a beautiful beat to it, “I Can’t Stand Myself (When You Touch Me)" by James Brown. But “Lonesome One,” it’s got so much feeling to it that I’d like to one day do it on stage – to let the audience know that I’ve got a lot of things inside me that I just want to explode.</span>

&nbsp;
<p style="text-align: center;">***</p>

		<title>Stump Speech: “School-to-Prison Pipeline”</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Stump Speech is a recurring series that examines the language used on the campaign trail – how well it works, and who’s behind it.</h3>
<h3>Definition</h3>
A <a href="https://www.aclu.org/fact-sheet/what-school-prison-pipeline">system of student discipline</a> that leads at-risk children to be incarcerated later in life.
<h3>Recent sighting</h3>
During a speech the <a href="http://www.theroot.com/blogs/the_grapevine/2016/02/new_yorker_s_cover_art_pays_homage_harlem_s_schomburg_center.html">Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture</a> in Harlem, Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2016/02/black-votes-matter">pledged $2 billion</a> to reform classroom discipline policies that disproportionately affect minority students. Specifically, she said she would hire guidance counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and other school support staff.

[iframe id="http://www.cbsnews.com/common/video/cbsnews_video.swf"]
<div class="cbs-resources"></div>
The timing of Clinton’s speech was widely seen as an appeal to African-American voters – whom she must win over in the South Carolina Democratic primary on February 27. She accused the GOP of using “coded racial language” to disparage President Obama. And she used a bit of coded language herself – calling the pattern of school discipline that disproportionately affects minority children the “school-to-prison pipeline.” Clinton advocated for a “cradle-to-college pipeline” instead.
<h3>Who’s behind it</h3>
Harvard University’s Nancy Heitzeg <a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ870076.pdf">credits</a> researchers Johanna Wald and Daniel J. Losen with the <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/yd.51/abstract">first use of the term</a> in 2003. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought the phrase to greater prominence with its 2005 paper “Interrupting the School to Prison Pipe-line.”

The system has also been called the “schoolhouse to jailhouse track” by the Advancement Project or the “cradle to prison track” by the Children‘s Defense Fund.
<h3>Our take</h3>
A “pipeline” doesn’t seem like the best metaphor. First, it dehumanizes: <em>objects</em> pass through a pipeline, not people. Second, it doesn’t reflect any firsthand experience. It sounds detached – the language of a researcher describing a process, rather than an advocate seeking to change it.

I’d recommend a phrase that more clearly evokes the image of an overcrowded, zero-tolerance classroom: the “prison within our schools” or children who become permanently “expelled” from society.

		<title>Context Matters: Ask the CDC</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/03/13913/</link>

<tbody>
<tr>

<p class="author"><em>By Sam Nurick, Account Coordinator, and Beth Kanter, Executive Vice President</em></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Even the best of intentions can fall flat if you don’t consider the context in which they will be received. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) learned this the hard way last month when it issued a <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/p0202-alcohol-exposed-pregnancy.html" target="_blank">report</a> discouraging pregnant and “pre-pregnant” women from drinking.

Good intention: Prevent fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) by communicating with women of childbearing age about the effect of alcohol on fetuses in the first few weeks of pregnancy.

<img class="aligncenter" src="http://cdn.thinkprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/03104856/CaTFrHkVAAABNrF.jpg" alt="" />Reality: Women found the report condescending, offensive and in some cases <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BBaK5SCxT9e/" target="_blank">laughable</a>. The report encouraged health providers to advise ALL women not currently on birth control to stop drinking in case of an unplanned pregnancy, and included an infographic (see right) that claimed drinking puts “any woman” at risk of injury, sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancy. Responses were swift and widespread, reaching over 112 million people on Twitter alone. Highly shared articles ranged from <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cdc-alcohol-young-women-pregnancy-warning_us_56b22f03e4b04f9b57d805bc" target="_blank">mild critiques</a> of the CDC’s poor word choices to <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/morganshanahan/things-women-should-probably-stop-doing-in-case-they-get-pre#.qdlaYXKV8" target="_blank">biting sarcasm</a>, likening the warning to a Saudi Arabia-style driving ban. The CDC broke the Internet, and not in a good way.

In Spitfire’s <a href="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SPT-SmartPlan-Updated-1.pdf" target="_blank">Smart Plan</a>, we encourage organizations to assess their vulnerabilities and consider what actions they can take to minimize the chance of controversy. The CDC clearly skipped this step. If it had gone through this exercise, it would have measured the hotly-charged political environment around women’s reproductive health and hopefully chosen its words more thoughtfully.

The CDC’s response only fueled the controversy. Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director, admitted they (CDC) “weren’t as clear as we had hoped to be,” while Lela McKnight-Eily, a doctor on the FASD prevention team, maintained the report “definitely didn’t make any recommendations for women who are pre-pregnant.” Both officials emphasized the purpose of the report was to empower and inform women, but failed to acknowledge the real root of the criticism – the report came across as patronizing and presented <a href="http://mashable.com/2016/02/03/cdc-pregnancy-alcohol/#pAw0bBJSREqs" target="_blank">women foremost as vessels for human life</a>. The CDC’s responses reinforced this connotation by categorizing young, not-currently-pregnant women with the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2016/02/new-front-battle-control-women-s-bodies" target="_blank">problematic term, “pre-pregnant.”</a>
Still in the hot seat, the CDC modified the original infographic (see left) to say alcohol puts <em>all</em>people at risk for injury, STDs, etc. and included a male figure. But they didn’t tell anyone they changed it. Ethics-focused science writer Kelly Hills first noted the change on <a href="http://www.kellyhills.com/blog/lying-liars-who-lie-the-internet-is-forever-cdc-edition/#sthash.0u65dpxM.VSFpjOCj.dpbs" target="_blank">her blog</a>, showing that the website included no marked edits. Speaking about the CDC she noted, “Changing graphics in response to outrage without acknowledging the outrage or why it existed doesn’t help their credibility, it just hurts it further.” Since then, the CDC has <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/fasd/index.html" target="_blank">removed the graphic entirely</a> – again without explanation.

The CDC could have avoided this entire backlash by paying more attention to context. If it had considered the current political climate, it would have made the connection between its intent and how it could be perceived. And while the CDC didn’t break the cardinal rule of crisis communication – don’t lie – it came pretty close by not disclosing that it changed the infographic.

<div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2355" class="email-wrapped">
<div id="yiv1073845814">
<div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2354" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">By Zach Schlein and Riyana Lalani</p>
<p dir="ltr">Alynda Segarra of Hurray for the Riff Raff has never been one to shy away from speaking her mind.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Although best known as the front woman and songwriter for her beloved folk band, Segarra has also become something of a figurehead for achieving social justice through music. Picking up on the legacy left by socially conscious-folk trailblazers such as Pete Seeger, Segarra is equally adept at both sharing stories and conveying uncomfortable truths to listeners.</p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2365" dir="ltr"><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2364">Beyond her lyricism, Segarra’s non-musical endeavors have illuminated her commitment to leaving the world a better place than how she found it. Through her work with organizations such as Radical Monarchs and her own Body Electric Fund, Segarra is an inspiration for many seeking to achieve a more just, equitable world.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">We had the chance to speak with Segarra on identity politics, overcoming one’s fears and insecurities, as well as the importance of alleviating pain through art.</p>

<div id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2372" dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: So much of your music and persona revolves around making substantive, palpable change in the world around you. How does it feel to be headlining a festival that shares those values?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">It's a great feeling to share space with other artists who feel like social justice is a part of their work.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: Although the tragedies you speak and write about occur on a global scale, many of the incidents you touch on have pointedly happened in Florida; “The Body Electric” was inspired by the story of Marissa Alexander, and your campaign of the same name collaborated with the Trayvon Martin Foundation. Is it odd at all to be performing in a state that has, in a very direct manner, driven the course of your work and causes?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I don't feel it is odd at all: Florida is where much of my family has moved to since New York has become so expensive. The Puerto Rican population is growing in Florida, so I feel connected to the state. From my experience, Latinos in Florida have kept a hold on their culture in spite of living in a racist environment. It is a very powerful feeling for me – after living for some time in Tennessee – to be amongst that energy.</p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2367" dir="ltr"><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2366">The stories of Trayvon Martin and Marissa Alexander struck me, and I felt like I needed to use whatever platform I have to do my part in the struggle against a racist and sexist society. My goal is to be vocal about their stories because first, they are examples of injustice, and second, I have skin privilege: Puerto Rican people are of Taino, Spanish and African descent. We come in all colors, and I am aware that in society, I have been treated differently than someone darker than me. I also have been in situations where I am very aware I am Latino, not white. It is my unique experience that makes me struggle to always be aware and to use my voice. To me, the black lives matter movement has been amazing to witness, and I do not feel like the statement "Black Lives Matter" in any way belittles my own life. I think it is important; It is okay for us to focus on this specific racism and legacy of brutality. </span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: Having worked so hard yourself towards social justice, how can individuals combat institutionalized oppression on a day-to-day basis?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I do not have answers for everyone, but I know for myself, I have had to do some research into my own people and our history. Researching the history of the Young Lords in NYC has given me a renewed sense of pride in my people. In my research, I learned a lot about the history of the Island and the ways my ancestors have been oppressed throughout time. Knowing the history of your people and where you come from, gives you the power to work for the freedom of others.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Here are some tips I have for Poc, Woc, queer people or anyone who falls into the intersection of these identities:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Find out about people who share your background, who've changed history. When I began reading the poetry of Julia De Burgos, I felt like I was continuing the lineage of Puerto Rican feminist poets.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Surround yourself with images and representations of your people that are positive and empowering. There are some awesome Instagram accounts, like latinarebels, moremodelsofcolor, etc that can give you positive images to see everyday that aren’t portrayed in mainstream media.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Surround yourself with people who respect and love all parts of your identity. If this is not possible, try your best to reach out to a loving community online. Never give up on the fact that there are people out there who respect you as you are.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Take self-care seriously and admit to yourself that the oppression you face is real. Do not let others convince you it is not real, because they have privilege that makes it not a part of their day to day life.</p>
<p id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2375" dir="ltr"><strong><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2374">Q: In interviews, you’ve spoken at length about feeling like and being an “other.” As you talked about in your public call to justice, interviewers and critics have been quick to tokenize or fetishize your status as a female folk singer with </span><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1456415643857_2376">Puerto Rican heritage. Fortunately, you’ve been able to channel your identity and life into having a positive impact not only for yourself, but for countless fans and listeners. How can those who feel like an “other” or feel ostracized translate their tribulations into a meaningful, self-affirming life?</span></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I think pride is everything. Examining my internalized racism and my internalized misogyny is a long process that has been rewarding and difficult for me. I have worked hard to feel proud of who I am and where I come from. I will always experience situations where my identity will become a token, but I do my best to believe in my abilities despite that. Having a community of people who encourage and challenge me is key.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I have also taken the time to listen to others experiences. For example, I watch lectures by Junot Diaz and Toni Morrison sometimes to hear their experience as writers and as people of color in the public eye. I try to always see myself as one part of a web of stories and work that must be told if we are going to change popular culture in America such that people of color and women can represent themselves.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Q: This festival, like your music, is hoping to inspire people to walk away with a renewed sense of purpose, power and drive to affect change. In an ideal world, what do you hope people take away from this gathering and your performance?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Everyone is capable of art, it is never too late and you do not need a formal education. I want to encourage people to follow their desire to create art however they can, especially for their own healing. Not everyone will be a public entertainer, but it's important for us to celebrate folk art and music in our everyday lives.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 was about the moments. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether it was hearing from one of our great speakers, meeting someone with similar passions or having great conversation, this year we wanted to create moments of inspiration, clarity and purpose. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once again, we transformed Gainesville, Florida, into the destination for people of purpose – a place where movement builders from all over the world met to hear from changemakers on the front lines of change and a place to build lasting connections.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year we heard from people like </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156730446"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steve Pargett</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the d</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">irector of communications and culture for the Dream Defenders</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who works tirelessly to amplify the voices of people of color; </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156633823"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brian Sheehan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">the co-director of the Yes Equality campaign for the marriage referendum in Ireland; </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156639043"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eileen Howard Boone</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, s</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">enior vice president at the CVS Health Foundation, who worked with the company to end the sale of cigarettes</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156888418"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Curt Guyette</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a reporter at Michigan ACLU, who shared the moving story of how he broke the Flint water disaster.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-13966 " src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-8.28.19-PM-1024x539.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-29 at 8.28.19 PM" width="578" height="304" /></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To kick off our new podcast, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://vimeo.com/156729364">7 Minutes in Heaven with a Scientist: Because Everyone is a Little Bit Curious</a> – </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">where we interview our academic crushes – we sat down with three leading scholars. These researchers competed for the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 $10,000 </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/prize/">Prize for Research in Public Interest Communications</a>, and after the <em>frank</em> audience voted, </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156870002"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dr. Troy Campbell</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> walked away as our winner. </span>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.20.44-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-13975 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.20.44-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-29 at 9.20.44 PM" width="477" height="485" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">From </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156623835"><span style="font-weight: 400;">poets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156637445"><span style="font-weight: 400;">artists</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to leading </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156638027"><span style="font-weight: 400;">scholars</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156777701"><span style="font-weight: 400;">coders</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, to </span><a href="https://vimeo.com/156633821"><span style="font-weight: 400;">storytelling gurus</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we heard from people who have dedicated their lives to using their craft to drive change.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is about learning from leading minds in public interest communications, it is also about creating a community of people who speak for the greater good. To do so, we designed moments for connection.</span>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-8.46.09-PM.png">
</a><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.25.20-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-13979 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.25.20-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-29 at 9.25.20 PM" width="573" height="566" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We had successful scrums, small curated discussions around important issues, and we had a progressive dinner, where <em>frank</em>sters were able to meet each other for drinks, dinner and great conversation. We also took </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to the streets with our </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016-community-street-fair/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gainesville Community Street Fair.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> We invited the local community to a free concert featuring Gainesville native Charles Bradley. We danced, we talked and we grooved to the music of the </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/02/charles-bradley/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Screaming Eagle of Soul.”</span></a>

&nbsp;

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.23.22-PM.png"><img class="wp-image-13978 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.23.22-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-29 at 9.23.22 PM" width="513" height="540" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year, we also introduced </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/scholar/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (scholar, 2016)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="http://changeville.us"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Changeville</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At <em>frank</em> (scholar, 2016), 30 leading minds from a range of academic disciplines spent the day together talking about the role of research in driving change. We designed </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (scholar, 2016) to be an incubator for good ideas. During this meeting, scholars were encouraged to brainstorm projects they wish existed – projects that could drive change.</span>

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.15.21-PM.png"><img class=" wp-image-13972 aligncenter" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Screen-Shot-2016-02-29-at-9.15.21-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2016-02-29 at 9.15.21 PM" width="511" height="529" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During this meeting, we launched the first </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (scholar,2016)  project with Dr. Natalie Tindall, an assistant professor at Georgia State University. She said many public relations companies do not hire people of color because they say they have a hard time finding applicants. However, Dr. Tindall said she knows that there is a large pool of talented people of color in P.R., so, she decided to create an open list of qualified students and professionals of color.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (To join this list, please </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">fill out this <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/fX62p7Nt6g">form</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. For more information, contact Dr. Tindall at </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ntindall@gsu.edu.) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">At </span><a href="http://changeville.us">Changeville</a>, a music, film and art festival, we featured the work of artists driving change through their work. The lineup included music from Hurray for the Riff Raff, The Mountain Goats, Wax Wings, Il Gato and more. Changeville was also home to one of the first virtual reality film festivals that included work from RYOT and Empathetic Media.

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">2016 was a magical week. There were so many incredible moments, it is hard to pinpoint just a few. </span>

We can’t wait to start planning for next year, and, more importantly, we can’t wait to see you there.

		<title>300 Public Interest Communicators Walked Into a Bar</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="post-title"><em>By Alina Evans, Account Coordinator at Spitfire Strategies</em></p>

<div class="entry">

Last week, I participated in<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/what-is-frank/" target="_blank"> <em>frank</em></a>, an annual gathering that Spitfire supports to bring together movers and shakers who use strategic communication to drive positive social change. Trends and best practices constantly evolve as change makers test new campaign strategies, develop new technologies and conduct new research. <em>frank</em> focuses on building a community that connects public interest communicators including researchers, students and practitioners so that they become even more effective in their work – and it does so in an approachable, fun way that feels as comfortable as your neighborhood bar.

Over the three-day gathering, more than 30 inspiring speakers distilled their insights into short talks – check out the <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank-talks/" target="_blank">videos available online</a>. Here are just a few of the highlights.

Want to change public opinion? Use humor – if it’s actually funny. Caty Borum-Chattoo from the <a href="http://www.cmsimpact.org/" target="_blank">Center for Media and Social Impact</a> showed how comedians are the latest sources for news. Remember when President Obama appeared on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnW3xkHxIEQ" target="_blank">Between Two Ferns</a> to ask young people to sign up for the Affordable Care Act? Traffic to HealthCare.gov increased by 40 percent. Humor also can be a powerful method to change public opinion, because it’s much harder to dislike someone who you think is funny. Comedy series featuring gay couples, such as Mitch and Cameron from Modern Family, have contributed to the decline in opposition to gay marriage. But she warned: don’t let strategists write comedy. Instead, work with comedians to craft comedy that will engage audiences.

Want your followers to take action after liking your post? De-emphasize morality. Social scientist Yu-Hao Lee from the University of Florida talked about his <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/docs/lee-chi2013-slacktivism.pdf" target="_blank">research on slacktivism</a> and demonstrated how social media campaigns can have the unintended effect of reducing activism. When an organization tells its members that they are “good people” for signing a petition, those people are less likely to take action later because they believe they’ve already fulfilled their moral obligation to help. To avoid this situation, Lee advised strategists to de-emphasize morality in the ask, and instead urge people to take action based on the issue, situation or context.

Want your target audience to empathize with your issue? Focus on an individual. Paul Slovic, a professor at the University of Oregon, talked about his 15-year project proving that people are more likely to empathize with an individual than a group. Statistics of mass murder or genocide, no matter how large the numbers, fail to convey the true nature of such atrocities. The numbers don’t spark significant emotion or feeling and thus fail to motivate action. However, when one person is killed unjustly and we hear about it, we react. For example, countless reports tell us that the death toll in Syria is more than 400,000 – a figure that hasn’t inspired the appropriate public interest in Syrian refugees. However, when the photo appeared of Aylan, the young Syrian boy whose body washed up on a beach, there was a spike in interest and action. The Swedish Red Cross, which has been helping Syrian refugees, reported steady donations of about $30,000 per day. When <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/09/03/a-desperate-refugee-family-a-capsized-boat-and-3-year-old-dead-on-a-beach-in-turkey/" target="_blank">Aylan’s photo and story</a>hit the news cycle, donations rose to $500,000 per day, and remained elevated for the next few days.

Want to reach viewers in a new and different way? Try virtual reality. Dan Archer of <a href="http://www.empatheticmedia.com/" target="_blank">Empathetic Media</a> showcased virtual reality software using the <a href="https://www.oculus.com/en-us/rift/" target="_blank">Oculus Rift</a> that aims to tell news stories in an immersive new way. With the software, Archer took us on a virtual walk around the scene of Michael Brown’s death, demonstrating how Officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Brown. While not all organizations can afford to send the Oculus Rift to the audience they want to influence, Archer does provide us a glimpse into possibilities of the future. The price of this technology will decrease, and for now, there’s <a href="https://www.google.com/get/cardboard/" target="_blank">Google cardboard</a>, the company’s affordable answer to virtual reality.

I’m looking for ways to put these insights to work in the campaigns I work on at Spitfire. And I’m feeling inspired after spending three days with people, who like us, use communication to create a world that protects the environment and improves the quality of life for all people. I’m glad I walked into <em>frank</em>.

		<title>The Flint Water Crisis and the Power of Truth</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://www.burness.com/power-of-truth/">Burness.</a></em></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every year, a handful of Burnessers head to Gainesville, Florida, for <em><a href="https://frank.jou.ufl.edu/"><span class="s2">frank</span></a></em>, a gathering of people who use strategic communications to drive social change. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Burness’ connections to frank run deep. The gathering was named in homage to Andy Burness’ mentor <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/what-is-frank/frank-karel-2/"><span class="s3">Frank Karel</span></a>. Burness manages the <a href="http://www.karelfellowship.org/about-the-fellowship/"><span class="s3">Karel Fellowship</span></a>, a summer program for undergraduate students who want to work in the field of public interest communications. Burness leadership advises different elements of the frank program, and I served as the marketing and outreach director for the gathering during its inception while I was an undergrad at University of Florida.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So, we are big <em>frank</em> fans. We’ve seen it grow in just three years from a humble convening of dozens of people interested in social good to a full-fledged “tribe” that draws participants from far and wide and speakers that may fly under the radar, but are changing the world in meaningful and strategic ways.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I’ve had many “frank moments” over the years, but none has been as memorable as hearing investigative journalist Curt Guyette tell how he broke the story of the Flint water crisis. If you haven’t heard of Curt yet, he’s basically the Erin Brockovich of our time. Through his reporting, he likely has saved thousands of lives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At<em> frank</em>, he spoke of the</span><span class="s4"> avoidable, man-made disaster in Flint, Michigan, in which the government, which is supposed to keep its citizens safe, knowingly poisoned children—all, in his words, “to save a few million bucks.” </span><span class="s1"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I don’t want to give details of his talk away because I highly encourage you to watch all 20 minutes of it below, but here’s one of his quotes that touched me most:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">“We’ve heard a lot of talk about the power of storytelling. But there’s another power. It’s the power of investigating and unearthing the truth. The truth is a very powerful thing when it’s unleashed. And that is what happened in Flint. Residents refused to believe the lie that their water was safe.”   </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To understand just how deep this disaster goes, check out his talk for yourself, and head to the <a href="https://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/03/13965/"><span class="s2"><em>frank</em> digest</span></a> to learn more about the other amazing folks we met and heard at the gathering. </span></p>

		<title>Telling Women&#039;s Stories to Drive Change: An Interview with The Goddess Project</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Across the globe, people are celebrating International Women’s Day by sharing economic, political and social achievements that women have made.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The many successes in the pursuit of gender equality are a result of strategic efforts to transform culture and politics and inspire women to take action.</span>

One of the ways women have done this is by using different media platforms – like zines, music, books and film – to reach other women, challenge stereotypes of women in pop culture and to tell the stories of their lives.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In honor of International Women’s Day, I talked with Sara Landas and Holli Rae, the filmmakers behind the new grassroots documentary, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://thegoddessproject.com/home.html">The Goddess Project</a></span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, about their film, the role of media in driving change and why it is important to tell stories about women’s lives.</span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the summer of 2012, while living in San Francisco, Landas and Rae met inspiring women who were overcoming their fears and changing the world by being themselves and creating transformative projects. After meeting these women, the two filmmakers said they wanted to travel the country and tell the stories of women who were doing similar work as a way to empower other women to do the same.</span>

So, they sold all their belongings, had three successful crowdsourcing campaigns to fund their project and hit the road in a mini school bus powered by vegetable oil.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After speaking with more than 100 women from all walks of life – from professionals and scholars to musicians and other women searching for their next role in life, they are now wrapping up post-production of their film and are prepping for its release.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Q: What inspired your film?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, we made a pact to start living out our dreams and to contribute to the world in a bigger way, and we immediately met other women who were doing the same. After getting to know these women, we saw that our fears and obstacles were so similar. Through our conversations, we were able to learn different ways to overcome them. We realized how empowering it is to hear stories from women that you can relate to, so we decided we wanted to travel the country and share the stories of women.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also wanted to see a broader spectrum of women in the media. Movies play a huge role in shaping our culture, and we felt frustrated by the constant bombardment of the same stereotypical roles. Women need more content that empowers them rather than focusing on their problems, so we decided to document inspiring real-life stories.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Q: Can you tell us a bit about your film?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of our film</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is to educate and empower viewers to leave the theatre feeling like they have the ability to overcome their personal obstacles and begin to contribute to the world in a bigger way. </span>

Our call to action is “Others see their possibilities in your reality,” because we have personally witnessed the incredible transformation that comes when you find a role model who is relevant to you. By showcasing diverse women in the same frame, we aim to bridge the gaps that separate us from one another and broaden the definition of empowerment and success in today’s society.

&nbsp;

<b>Q: What is the role of media in driving change?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Audiences worldwide are looking to social media, television and movies to learn about themselves and discover who they want to become in life, so media is shaping our culture now more than ever.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe that media is one of the most powerful tools we have to work with today. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating content that cuts through the chatter and really connects with your audience on a real and intimate level is one of the most effective ways to drive change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating a connection for someone through a story is a powerful way to transform beliefs and move people to take action. If a story resonates with someone on an emotional level, it produces a sort of empathy that has the potential to create real and lasting change.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Q: Why is it important to tell stories about women’s lives?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So often the stories we are told about women’s experiences are oversimplified and one-dimensional. It’s important for women to be able to see themselves in the media we create, so it’s time that we have more diverse subjects and tell complex and impactful stories. When we see others doing amazing things, we can see possibilities for ourselves. As Geena Davis says, “If she can see it, she can be it.” </span>

It’s also important to have people behind the camera that can deeply understand the experience of those in front of the camera. When you have diversity in all aspects of production then you are able to successfully tell different and complex stories.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our film is powered by women. From the women in the the film to our music score, to our animators, to our team of lawyers, we wanted our film to be collaborative and reflect the lives and diverse viewpoints of women. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Q: Your project was completely funded through crowdsourcing campaigns. How did you do that?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We realized that in order to reach our goal we had to broaden our audience and we had to ask people for help. Most of the time people were willing and excited to contribute, the hardest part was building up the courage to ask.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s challenging, but continued outreach to individuals, organizations, companies and influencers that share a similar passion or vision is fundamental to a successful campaign. There are so many people out there just waiting to connect and help contribute to your mission. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Using social media is one of the most effective tools when running a campaign. We used Vimeo, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram to find people who believed in what we were doing and who wanted to be</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">a part</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of it. It was important for us to build a community with our followers, so we spent a lot of our time fostering relationships through social media.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Resilience is also key. You need to be so passionate about your project that you're willing to live and breathe it 24/7. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Q: What is your advice for others using film to drive change?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be afraid to put yourself out there and learn along the way. It takes a lot of energy and self motivation, but if you have a clear message and you continue to charge forward you will have an impact.</span>

<h2><strong>China gives a damn about its bad reputation.
</strong></h2>

<h3>How ‘Made in China’ Got a Bad Reputation</h3>
A huge obstacle for public diplomacy is media coverage. Researchers recently tackled the issue of how American media is impacting China’s national image in the United States. If countries – or any organizations that work abroad – want to change public opinion, it is important to understand how the news influences the audience.

<h2>Feeling feelings is good for your health.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Social Media Cure</h3>
It is hard to express pain on a scale from zero to 10, especially if you have a chronic illness. However, communities are forming on Instagram and Tumblr where chronically ill people can share memes of their experience. Communities like these allow us to better understand the pain they are feeling.

<h3>How to Teach Doctors Empathy</h3>
Clinical empathy – when doctors acknowledge and relate to the pain of their patients – is an essential skill when it comes to communicating health issues, but doctors frequently disregard it. The Atlantic explores the power of “Oncotalk” and other programs developed by medical programs across the U.S. This level of empathy is significant at all levels of health communications.

<h3>CVS to Spend $50 Million on Antismoking Program Aimed at Youths</h3>
The goal of CVS Health is to help people achieve better health. The CVS team made this very clear when it decided to take tobacco products of the shelves. Now it is making history again as the company kicks off the #BeTheFirst campaign, seeking to create the first tobacco-free generation. Follow this multimedia campaign as CVS continues to make meaningful social change.

<h3>Men Recite Sexist Things Women Have to Deal With at Work</h3>
To tackle institutionalized sexism, the Ad Agency TBWA launched #TakeTheLead2020. In this campaign, men read aloud quotes from women who work in the advertising industry. This is a way to illustrate the double standard that exists in the workplace.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Do you and your nonprofit colleagues know the audiences you want to reach and the messages you want to deliver? Congratulations!

Now you’re ready for your next challenge: You need to communicate your organization’s messages effectively, especially to reporters, community leaders and funders.

One of the best tools you can use to do this is the message box, a technique created by political campaigns. It’s <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=24KVqPg_DvsC&amp;pg=PA54&amp;lpg=PA54&amp;dq=examples+of+message+boxes+media+relations&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QiALIMXhIj&amp;sig=URpbFmCo5RKcYYeAi2pb-nn3-As&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI4OPBjLTLAhVI7mMKHePNC5wQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=examples%20of%20message%20boxes%20media%20relations&amp;f=false">a simple device that political operatives created to help candidates stay on message</a>.

You can use the same technique to make sure your nonprofit delivers consistent, persuasive messages. A message box is a terrific tool to have handy when you’re talking to reporters, preparing for presentations, or getting ready for meetings with donors and other supporters.

<b>What Every Message Box Needs to Do</b>

A good message box identifies the specific audience you want to reach and your most important messages.

While you can create message boxes for different issues, you’ll want to start with one box that answers four questions: why your nonprofit exists, how you work, who is involved, and what you have accomplished.

<b>Four Questions to Ask Yourself</b>

How can you build your own message box?

Begin by drawing four squares on a piece of paper. Start in the upper left hand corner, move clockwise, and in each square jot down answers to these four questions:

<strong>1)</strong> Why does your organization exist? What’s the problem you’re tackling and the solution you offer, and why does it matter?

<strong>2)</strong> How do you do your work? Talk about your services, your approach, and your team.

<strong>3)</strong> Who is involved or can help? List your partners, past and current, and tell people how they can support you.

<strong>4)</strong> What results have you produced? Describe your outcomes and share stories of the people you serve or your partners and teammates.

Keep your answers short. You need to keep your text to one page. Use simple, easily understandable words and avoid acronyms and professional jargon.

Here’s a chart you can use to get started in writing your own message box:

<img class="alignnone wp-image-4208" src="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-3.18.26-PM-1024x931.png" sizes="(max-width: 601px) 100vw, 601px" srcset="http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-3.18.26-PM-300x273.png 300x, http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-3.18.26-PM-768x698.png 768x, http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-3.18.26-PM-1024x931.png 1024x, http://www.prichardcommunications.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-09-at-3.18.26-PM.png 1056x" alt="Screen Shot 2016-03-09 at 3.18.26 PM" width="601" height="546" />

<h2>How much is too much?</h2>

<hr />

<h3> <span style="font-weight: 400;">In Human Rights Reporting, the Perils of too Much Information</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">New technology, including Twitter and geo-referenced field documentation, is opening doors for  journalists, especially with the help of human rights organizations who can reach locations that journalist cannot visit. But access to all this information requires a cautious eye. Journalists need to decide if the information is reliable, who can access it and how much to give.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.cjr.org/criticism/in_human_rights_reporting_the_perils_of_too_much_information.php">Columbia Journalism Review</a></span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Banning Words On Instagram Totally Backfired</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this week’s example of “why we need to make research-based decisions”: Georgia Institute of Technology found that participation in pro-eating disorder communities increased by as much as 30 percent after these communities found ways to communicate around Instagram’s keyword ban. Research can help us know if we are doing too much before we start a campaign.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.futurity.org/instagram-ban-words-1119732-2/?utm_source=Futurity+Today&amp;utm_campaign=c8dde8caad-March_14_20163_14_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e34e8ee443-c8dde8caad-206336457">Futurity</a></span>

&nbsp;
<h2>Freed Willy</h2>

<hr />

<h3> <span style="font-weight: 400;">The End of SeaWorld's Orca-Breeding Program</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After multiple protests and lowered attendance to the parks, SeaWorld announced that it would no longer breed orcas in captivity. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blackfish</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> started this movement, showing how a film can create meaningful behavior change. SeaWorld said it best: “Society is changing and we’re changing with it.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/03/sea-world-orcas/474189/">The Atlantic</a></span>

&nbsp;
<h2>What the health?</h2>

<hr />

<h3> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Abortion Booklets from States are Misinforming Women</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by Rutgers University analyzed informational booklets from 23 states and found that 31 percent of the information about embryological and fetal development was inaccurate. Patients deserve to be given correct information about their health.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.futurity.org/informed-consent-abortion-1112912-2/?utm_source=Futurity+Today&amp;utm_campaign=c4d7346020-March_2_20163_2_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_e34e8ee443-c4d7346020-206336457">Futurity</a></span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Youngest Casualties in the War on Obesity</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Public weighing and BMI checks in schools, which is not supported by the CDC, has played a role in the increase of eating disorders like anorexia, bulimia and binge eating disorder. Kathleen MacDonald from the national Eating Disorder Coalition worked tirelessly to change this practice, inspiring grassroots groups, parents and students to take action as well.</span>

<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Kady Berrier</span></em>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Every year at the <em>frank</em> gathering we hear from movement builders at the front lines of change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">These<em> frank</em>sters use strategic communications to drive positive long-lasting social change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The aim of their efforts is to do more than raise awareness. Rather, it is to design and lead projects that move people to change their behavior, to do something they have never done before that will benefit and transform their lives for the better.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this <em>frank</em> playlist, a CEO, a reporter and a student share the work they are doing to transform the lives of children through play, understanding their brains and transforming the American education system.</span>

<hr />

&nbsp;

[vimeo id="156888435"]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Jill Vialet, CEO and founder of Playworks, works towards implementing healthy and productive recess across the nation. Her work ensures that children have access to proper play in order to develop socially, emotionally, and physically.</span>

<hr />

&nbsp;

[vimeo id="121081127"]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Benedict Carey is a science reporter for the New York Times, focusing on the way we learn. His talk at </span><i>frank</i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shows us how our brains learn and how these methods should be implemented into the classroom for what he calls “Learning 101.”</span>

<hr />

[vimeo id="98656142"]

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Samir Rachid, a Karel fellow with the Education Trust, believes in the power of investing in children from low-income backgrounds and those from diverse demographic backgrounds. He advocates for people to believe in these kids because their failures are not a result of intelligence or dedication, but their background and the American education system as a whole.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">First Lady Michelle Obama told the South by Southwest crowd that women in pop culture can be powerful change makers, especially through hip-hop music. However, much like in</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">electoral politics, women are missing from</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">the genre. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Unfortunate Consequences for Men Who Work Part-Time</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">David Pedulla, a researcher from University of Texas at Austin, found that men with part-time employment history are less likely to be called back for interviews for full-time jobs than women. Pedulla believes that this phenomenon is rooted in sexism. He wants to continue his research to see if these biases are because people associate women with less desirable, part-time work. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Failure of the War on Drugs</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States is suffering from an opioid epidemic, ranging from painkillers to heroin. However, there is conflict about the right way to deal with this problem. A 50-year sentence ruled by a Louisiana judge shows that increased punishments are not the answer.</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">C.D.C. Painkiller Guidelines Aim to Reduce Addiction Risk</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In response to an increase in painkiller addiction across the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is adjusting its guidelines for prescription pain medication. Many doctors are prescribing highly-addictive opioid painkillers when they shouldn’t, resulting in more opioid deaths per capita. The federal agency now suggests prescribing pain relievers like ibuprofen before highly addictive pills like OxyContin. </span>

		<title>This is Our Time: A Call to Troublemakers</title>

As <em>f</em><i>ranksters</i> we know that helplessness isn’t an option.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s too much at stake to sit on the sidelines, and that’s why we are inclined to seize the moment. It’s why we take underpaying jobs in the nonprofit sector to help people in need, or why we shed light on pressing problems instead of succumbing to a sensationalist media machine, or why we’ll extend a helping hand when the odds tell us that success isn’t attainable.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Those stories of  hope and determination inspired me to create “Our Time,” a song that I premiered at <em>frank</em>2016.</span>

[vimeo id="156623835"]

Now, more than ever, we have to reclaim the narrative of our nation. When historians write about 2016, will they talk about politicians out of horror movies and the perpetuation of society’s most pressing issues? Or, will they talk about the ways people seized this moment and pushed for positive changes from coast to coast?

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I know that you’ll be on the right side of history, and I want to share your impact with the world. That’s why I’m creating a video for “Our Time” – a video that will showcase the work of troublemakers across the country. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether you are working with teens in the juvenile justice system or a documentarian or turning around schools in low-income areas, you are a troublemaker and your work embodies “Our Time.”</span></span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I was moved by our conversations at <em>frank</em>2016 after I performed “Our Time."</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> One person told me that it was the reminder they needed that our nation’s moment requires urgency. Another told me they were moved to tears and found a new source of fire for their work. These experiences tell me that “Our Time” isn’t my song. It’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">our</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> song. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to feature <em>frank</em>sters in a video for "Our Time." If you’re interested in participating in this video, </span>email me at <a href="mailto:ahmenmusic@gmail.com"><b>ahmenmusic@gmail.com</b></a> by April 8th<span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tell me about your work and what “Our Time” means to you. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>frank</em>sters, it’s our time. Let’s show the world that we’re beyond frustration and theory. We’re the troublemakers who are actually moving the needle. We will write the next chapter in our nation’s history. </span>

<em>Watch Ahmen's  frank2016talk, The Troublemaker Imperative.</em>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Aaron Zeiler, frank Social Media Director</em>
<blockquote>"The world is starving for answers and your words are food for thought." - <a href="https://vimeo.com/156888464">Get Lit Players, <em>frank</em>2016</a></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Using media to support women and girls</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3>The Hidden Vulnerabilities of @SoSadToday</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The @SoSadToday account came to Twitter in 2012, bringing with it an emotional honesty that has been said to be form of feminist resistance to modern gender roles. The sad girl culture, also exemplified by Tumblr and the music of Lana del Rey, allows women to articulate their thoughts. </span>

<h3>5 Things You Can Do to End Sexual Exploitation of Women and Girls in the Media</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Women are people. While this may seem self-explanatory, pop culture continues to mass-produce the sexual objectification of women and girls through television, books, ads and more. Fortunately, Safe magazine suggests five things you can do to stop the sexual exploitation of girls. Let’s fix it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.safe-magazine.com/5-things-can-end-sexual-exploitation-women-girls-media/#.VvPNnNDmoaU.mailto">Safe</a></span>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What’s God got to do with it?</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3>Conflict Between Science, Religion Lies in Our Brains</h3>
Faith and science require the use of separate parts of the brain: one part processes information through an empathetic network, while the other part uses an analytical network. Scientists say that people suppress their empathetic side when focusing on science, and vice versa. But religious scientists show that you can use both networks for thinking.

<h3>Choosing Love or the Mormon Church</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In November, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints introduced a new policy that made same-sex marriage and excommunicable offense, an action that shocked many faithful Mormons. While this has increased the struggle for LGBT Mormons, many are trying to find a way to bring their faith and love together. With the help of activist groups like Mormons Building Bridges (an ally group), a cultural change may come to the LDS church.</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, Netflix binges don’t count?</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3>Less Than 3 Percent of Americans Live a ‘Healthy Lifestyle’</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A new study published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings shows that less than 3 percent of Americans are living a “healthy lifestyle,” which includes 150 minutes of exercise a week and not smoking. While Americans are good at some of these qualifications (i.e. not smoking), very few can say they meet all four. What can we do to help people achieve a healthier life?</span>

<blockquote>"The process of getting the answer is in many ways more important than the answers."- <a href="https://vimeo.com/156888381">Rob Anderson,<em> frank</em>2016 </a></blockquote>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Policy Dilemma</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Say When</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservatives voice their support of economic liberty and opposition to government control; however, when it comes reproductive health issues, The Atlantic argues that conservatives push for unnecessary regulations and economic barriers. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/fans-of-economic-liberty-shouldnt-be-so-quick-to-regulate-abortion/475566/">The Atlantic</a></span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">NBA could move 2017 All-Star Game in wake of North Carolina LGBT Legislation</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The NBA slam-dunked this week when it stood up for LGBT rights. Following the example of the NFL and NCAA, the basketball organization announced that it would consider moving the 2017 All-Star Game out of Charlotte if North Carolina keeps its anti-LGBT law.  Pop culture is an important player in social change, a player that can make a huge difference in the eye of the public.</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The NRA Just Added Guns to Your Favorite Childhood Fairytales to Teach Us About “Safety”</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dear NRA, you had me at safety, but you lost me big time when you handed guns to my beloved fairytale characters. While it is true that these fairytales are very GRIM, adding guns to the stories do not make them better, especially when you consider that armed minors accidentally harmed 265 victims. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Video Campaign Urges U.S. to “See Something, Say Something” About Anti-Islam Bigotry</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all have that family member that says shockingly racist things at Thanksgiving dinner, but Anti-Islam bigotry is something that should not be tolerated in our country. Thankfully, People For the American Way’s new ad urges us to let everyone know that Anti-Islam bigotry is not the American way. </span>

		<title>The 5 Climate Change Communication Studies You Need to Know</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/03/climate-change-communication-studies/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Despite the mountain of scientific evidence that confirms that climate change is real and a result of human activity, it continues to be a polarizing issue in American politics. Advocates for climate change are continually seeking strategies to reach the people who maintain their denial and skepticism before it’s too late.

Even with targeted efforts to shift environmental attitudes, only one in 10 republicans believe climate change is occurring, while nine out of 10 Democrats do. Even more startling, 40 percent of adults worldwide have never heard of climate change.

There are a number of groups, including foundations, nonprofits, activists, institutes, scientists and politicians that work to increase support for climate change policies. However, their efforts often fail to move the right people.

It is commonly assumed that if you make people more science literate, by giving them understandable information on climate change science and policy, then denial will diminish. However, research says otherwise, suggesting deniers and skeptics often actively avoid or disbelieve the presented evidence.

To reach people on the issue of climate change, it is key that you speak to their head (their sense of rationality) and the heart (their emotions). But, importantly, what will speak to people is very much shaped by their various identities, that is who they are, what they value and how they see themselves.

Researchers suggest that messages that strategically tap into deniers and skeptics various identities- such as political and religious affiliations- can transform deniers into believers.
<h3>Here are the 5 climate change studies you need to know to move nonbelievers to believers.</h3>
&nbsp;

<strong>1.Liberals and conservatives have different moral values that shape their environmental support.</strong>

There is consensus among researchers that liberals support issues framed as avoiding harm and promoting equality, where conservatives support issues framed as respect for authority and preserving the sacred.

Climate change is often talked about using language that resonates with liberal moral values of protecting the environment from the harm caused by humans. As a result, liberals tend to view climate change as a moral issue, where conservatives do not. Researchers believe that the widespread use of this language is what leads to stronger support from the left.

Social psychologist Matthew Feinberg and sociologist Robb Willer tested whether using moral language that resonates with conservative moral values could increase skeptical republicans’ belief and support for climate change policies.

In their study, they showed conservative participants images of the consequences of climate change. Some participants saw images that tapped into conservative moral values of preserving the sacred. Images, for example, showed once pure water contaminated and a once pure forest covered in trash. Other participants saw images that tapped into liberal moral values of protection from harm. Images included a coral reef system being harmed by increased global warming and cracked ground from drought.

Conservative participants who saw images embedded in conservative values reported greater support of climate change policies, as compared to conservatives who saw images embedded in liberal values.

So, using language and images that tap into deniers and skeptics moral values can increase support for climate change, and eliminate differences in liberal and conservative environmental attitudes.

&nbsp;

<strong>2. Political ideology prevents people from accepting facts that threaten their worldview.</strong>

For conservatives, the conflicting nature of climate science to their worldview stops them from acknowledging the evidence. Correcting misinformation about climate change science and policies by providing graphs and charts can be effective, but only if the information does not threaten how they see themselves.

Political scientists Brendan Nyhan and Jason Reifler found that one way to diminish the threat of climate change information for people who strongly identify as Republican is by affirming their self-worth (or stroke their ego, as they say). They argue that doing so makes it easier for conservatives to cope with challenging information, as “it relaxes their need to reject facts that could otherwise be threatening.”

&nbsp;

<strong>3. People deny climate science if it is in their best interest to do so.</strong>

To diminish polarization around climate change, many believe providing more information on the science and policy can be effective. However, professor of psychology and law Dan Kahan and his colleagues found that polarization has less to do with lack of knowledge on climate science and more to do with people’s various identities.

In fact, people with the highest levels of science literacy and technical reasoning are more likely to express apathy toward climate change. Polarization stems not from the lack of understanding of the issue, but rather from a conflict of interest.

People are more likely to deny climate change information and policy if it is in their best interest to do so. For some people, the denial of scientific evidence is a rational choice.

For example, if one’s colleagues and friends are deniers and skeptics, supporting climate change policy can create a conflict in their relationship that may not outweigh the benefits of their support. Similarly, people do not like to do things they do not want to do. So, if one would be required to change their behavior- such as taking public transportation or not working for a particular corporation- denial of the consequences of their actions becomes a rational choice.

Climate change messages should not threaten people’s identities, the researchers suggest. Effective strategies should include using relevant and diverse messengers who have credibility within skeptics and deniers’ worlds, as well as creating messages that resonate with how they see themselves.

&nbsp;

<strong>4.The climate change message is the messenger.</strong>

Messengers who have credibility, authority and status within deniers and skeptics’ worlds can be effective at delivering information on climate change. However, who people trust for information on climate change varies.

In a study, social psychologist David Sleeth-Keppler and his colleagues wanted to know who people trusted for information about climate change.They gathered data on more than 1,700 Americans to see how much trust people have in formal communicators like scientists, government workers and politicians, as well as informal communicators like neighbors, church leaders and co-workers. They found that people who trusted formal communicators were just as likely to trust informal communicators. However, for people who had little trust in formal communicators, informal communicators were very important. For example, the researchers found that participants who were more conservative and more religious turned to religious leaders, neighbors and co-workers for information and solutions to climate change.

The person who delivers climate change information is just as important as how the information is presented.

&nbsp;

<strong> 5. </strong><strong>People support climate change action if they see how the consequences will affect their local communities.</strong>

Highlighting the local impact of climate change on communities can boost Independent and Republican support for local policy action, as well as intentions to change their behavior to be more environmentally friendly.

For example, a team of political scientists found that skeptical conservative participants in Indiana were more likely to take climate change seriously after watching a video that attributed the appearance of new pests in Indiana agricultural to global warming, as compared to those who saw a video on pests in agriculture in Europe and Asia.

In short, if we want to move deniers to believers, we have to strategically tap into their identities and use communicators and messages that align with their worldviews.

<h2>Trumping False Information</h2>

<hr />

<h3>How to Inoculate People Against Donald Trump’s Fact Bending Claims</h3>
According to Politifact, 78 percent of what Donald Trump says is false, but there are people who still support his outlandish claims. Fortunately, inoculation strategies – presenting the facts to ward off false statements – can help people identify lies.

This strategy can be useful not only in political situations. For example, <a href="https://vimeo.com/156777216">Jeff Niederdeppe</a>, <i>frank</i>2016 research prize finalist, found that inoculation strategies can counter false messages from powerful industries like big tobacco, soda and pharmaceutical companies.

<h3>The Exaggerated Influence of ISIS, Visualized</h3>
The news makes the ISIS threat seem much larger than it actually is. This has created a lot of serious issues for Muslims living in the United States and around the world. In this video, the Atlantic breaks down the power of ISIS, clarifying misinformation about the terrorist group.

&nbsp;
<h2>Science to the Rescue</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lifelong Health Toll of Schoolyard Racism</h3>
Racism, explicit and implicit, still exists in our country. Researchers from Northwestern University have identified long-lasting effects of racial discriminations. Discrimination in adolescence can influence the body’s cortisol levels, leading to cardiovascular disease, early mortality and other health issues in adulthood. One way to prevent this is for adults, regardless of race, to talk to children about race in a way that models positive interracial behavior.

<h3>Scientists have discovered an unbelievably simple new way to fight childhood obesity</h3>
Aaron Johnson, Jr., a middle school student from Jacksonville, Florida, argued to the U.S. Surgeon General that our conversations about childhood obesity don’t actually include kids.

New research suggests that water may be the key to solving the childhood obesity crisis. As a result, New York City schools are testing a new water program that is showing great success in lowering kids BMI.

&nbsp;
<h2>League of Kindness</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Can a Video Game Company Tame Toxic Behavior?</h3>
League of Legends, one of the largest online video games, is also known for a large amount of racist, sexist, homophobic and violent language. That’s why Riot Games turned to cognitive neuroscientist Jeffery Lin, Ph.D. from the University of Washington in Seattle. His solution: prime the players with messages about being good teammates.

Riot tested this strategy on millions of players, resulting in the reduction of offensive language by 11 percent.

<h2>Who Run the World?</h2>

<hr />

<h3>How the #EverydaySexism project empowers women</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though people try to deny it, sexism is still extremely prevalent in the 21st century. To show how often women experience sexist encounters, author Laura Bates started the Everyday Sexism Project, which is focused on displaying just some of these actions. With more than 100,000 stories from women and girls, Bates’ project is a perfect example of why we still need feminism.</span>

<h3>Here's Why Women Everywhere Will Delete Uber On April 19</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Pelletz, a former Uber driver, saw a major problem with the ride-providing service: large amounts of female drivers and passengers were being sexually assaulted during their ride. He and his wife decided to launch a separate app, Chariot for Women, that provides the same service, but the drivers and passengers are all women. Not only does this service focus on making women safe, but also parts of the proceeds go to help women-focused charities. </span>

<h3>9 year old Journalist Responds to Her Critics and Becomes a Media Star</h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">9-year-old Hilde Lysiak is the publisher and reporter for her monthly newspaper, The Orange Street News. Despite the skill she has shown, Hilde has a large number of critics who attack her for her age. Communication-based fields provide huge opportunities for youth to get involved and generate meaningful change.</span>

<h2><strong>How to Tell 360 Degree Stories</strong></h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Storyteller’s Guide to the Virtual Reality Audience
<b></b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual reality gives us unprecedented storytelling ability, but what is the best way to tell it? Some VR storytellers tested how people reacted to three types of vision: 90 degrees (the viewer is bounded to 90 degrees of vision), 180 degrees and 360 degrees (the viewer can look all around them). They found that viewers were more engaged with a greater range of view, but they also retained less information. This means that communicators seeking to use VR to tell stories should consider if adding more information will be helpful or distracting.</span>

<h2><strong>They’re Coming for Your hashtag</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>#HillarySoQualified: Pro-Clinton Hashtag Goes Wrong Fast</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">A passionate Hillary Clinton supporter started the #HillarySoQualified campaign after Bernie Sanders claimed she was not “qualified” to be president. However, the hashtag was quickly taken over by people who wanted to use it sarcastically to point out Clinton’s flaws. Communicators take a big risk when forming their social media campaigns – just ask Clinton’s team. Make sure your hashtags are research-based, tested and strategic in order to prevent major takeovers.</span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="df38" class="graf--h3 graf--first">The excellent new show “Underground” shows the oppression and brutality of slavery, and at the same time, draws a parallel straight through to the racial injustices present in America today.</h3>
<p id="a4d0" class="graf--p graf-after--h4">American slavery has been depicted in film and on TV nearly as long as the medium has been in existence. Starting in 1915 with D.W. Griffith’s “Birth of a Nation” through to 1977 with television’s “Roots” and as recent as 2013 with the Academy Award winning Best Picture “12 Years A Slave,” audiences are very familiar with the brutality, inhumanity and horror of slavery. Less commonly told is the story of slaves who risked death by attempting to escape, many of them using the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2944.html" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4p2944.html">Underground Railroad</a>.</p>
<p id="e0ab" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Now, we have that story in the excellent new show on WGN called “Underground.”</p>
<p id="a0b9" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">For those who have not seen the show, here is your spoiler alert!</em></p>
<p id="8fdb" class="graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Underground” is a ten episode series that takes place in Antebellum Georgia on a cotton plantation called Macon. The story centers on the plantation slaves who plan a daring escape to the north using the 600 mile Underground Railroad. Much like the classic prison break movie <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Escape_%28film%29" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Escape_%28film%29">“The Great Escape,”</a> each slave character has a unique skill that enables them all to execute the plan as a whole. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://tvline.com/2016/03/30/underground-preview-aldis-hodge-noah-rosalee-on-run/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://tvline.com/2016/03/30/underground-preview-aldis-hodge-noah-rosalee-on-run/">Aldis Hodge is Noah</a>, the restless and inspired leader of the plan. Jurnee Smollett-Bell plays a house slave named Rosalee who is much tougher than meets the eye. Adina Porter is Pearly Mae, and her husband Moses is played by Mykelti Williamson. The possibly untrustworthy slave overseer Cato is Alano Miller, Johnny Ray Gill is Sam, Theodus Crane is Zeke, and Renwick Scott is Henry. Amirah Vann plays Ernestine, the cunning head house slave and mother of Rosalee, Sam, and six year old James. The white plantation owners Tom and Suzanna Macon are played with disaffected coldness by Reed Diamond and Andrea Frankle respectively. There are two abolitionists, John and Elizabeth Hawkes (Marc Blucas and Jessica De Gouw), and one morally ambiguous slave hunter named August Pullman played by Chris Meloni. The first three episodes set up the escape plan, and introduce the interconnecting plots of the lives of the owners and slaves. The fourth episode called “Firefly” puts the whole escape into motion.</p>

Color of Change is a trusted and proven leader in racial justice, and we were interested in seeing how we could connect the “Underground” audience to their work. We started by pointing to some incisive quotes from the show’s creator and television and social critics about the depiction of slavery on film and TV, because we were curious if the audience was making the connection that this show is different.</p>

</figure>
<p id="368a" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Sure enough, the Twitter audience passionately illustrated how much they have been wanting this story and these characters. The way the show represents the desire for freedom in the face of oppression and brutality, and then depicts the characters pursuing that freedom, draws a parallel straight through to the racial injustices present in America today. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://zap2it.com/2016/03/underground-adina-porter-alano-miller-firefly-wgn-america/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://zap2it.com/2016/03/underground-adina-porter-alano-miller-firefly-wgn-america/">In a direct nod to the killing of Mike Brown</a> in Ferguson, Missouri, the character of Pearly Mae protects her fleeing husband and daughter by facing the raised gun of the slave hunter Pullman, standing with her hands up, then dropping to her knees in sacrifice. It is a powerful and chilling moment.</p>

Josey holds the abolitionist couple John and Elizabeth Hawkes hostage for revenge in the taking of his wife Temperance from the plantation where they were together. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/dinin-like-white-folks-black-rage-as-sacred-in-und.html" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/03/dinin-like-white-folks-black-rage-as-sacred-in-und.html">Josey is seething with pain and rage</a>, and forces Elizabeth to whip John to get him to explain what happened to Tempy. The audience picked right up on the connection between the trauma of slavery and institutional racism, and how it affects our racial justice in the present day.

<p id="dc3f" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">At the end of this very harrowing episode, Cato, the black slave driver, kills the two white field overseers, sets the cotton fields on fire, and screams at the slaves to run. The fire serves as both a distraction for the escape, and an act of vengeance against the Macons. By decimating the cotton, the slaves leave them with a season’s total loss of income, and no one to work to rebuild.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens when a science prodigy loves literature and people? <a href="http://troyhcampbell.weebly.com">Troy Campbell.</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell is an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Oregon in the Lundquist College of Business, and our 2016 <em>frank</em> research prize winner.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From a young age Campbell was drawn to exploring the human condition and who exactly humans are. In college he took his first social psychology class, assuming he would study the work of couch psychologists (think Fraiser), but was surprised to find that psychology was a discipline where he could marry his talent in science with his love for understanding people.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his undergraduate career, Campbell worked with Elizabeth Loftus, one of the most famous living psychologists in the world and Peter Ditto his first social psychology professor.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As he went through college, he became fascinated with how people consume things and how mood and identity affect people’s experience consuming adventure parks, literature and more. Campbell quickly found that he didn’t want to be a couch psychologist. He had many conversations with Ditto about his desires to study what makes people happy and the human condition.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ditto then handed him the book “Predictably Irrational” by Dan Ariely, the James B. Duke professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University. Campbell would run home after school everyday to read a chapter out of the book. He remembers telling himself to savor every page because this was what he had been looking for.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He went on to get his Ph.D. in business marketing and consumer psychology from Duke University, studying under Ariely. During this time Campbell, under the advisory of Ariely, worked as a Disney Imagineer conducting research. “By the time I was 23 all of my dreams came true. I was a scientist and a Disney imagineer,” said Campbell.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In his last semester at Duke, Campbell received a dream job offer on Christmas day from the University of Oregon, a place that values and supports interdisciplinary work from researchers. Campbell now studies why people are averse to different social issues and how to overcome barriers through strategic communication.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Campbell won the 2016<em> frank</em> $10,000 prize for research in public interest communications for his paper Solution Aversion: On the Relation Between Ideology and Motivated Disbelief. Campbell and his colleague Aaron Kay found that people are averse to problems like climate change and gun control not because of the issue itself, but because of how the solution is framed. They found that framing solutions for these polarizing issues by using moral language that resonates with both political ideologies and values can be effective at reaching across the political aisle.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I talked with Campbell about his research, winning the $10,000 prize and what it was like to attend <em>frank</em> for the first time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>Annie: What is the relationship between your research and public interest communications?
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Troy: I call my research framing 2.0. There are tons of discussions about how we have to better frame messaging and everybody understands that, but what does that mean?  My research answers what that means.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People’s existing identities, beliefs, needs and desires are always going to be the film over their minds. So when you are framing a message what do you have to think about? Well, you have to think about people’s identities, beliefs and desires and insecurities and perceptions that surround them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>Why is understanding the relationship between identity and framing important for the field of public interest communications?
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are two reasons why it is important. First, the most important beliefs for people are the most important derivers of what they think. They are incredibly strong forces, as they are the most important beliefs to people, so they are going to be incredibly important to deal with.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, once you understand that your beliefs and identities are different from other people’s and that these are important, you have to figure out what you will do about it.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone’s beliefs come from the same psychology. Even the person you hate, everything they are doing is coming from the same human emotions of wanting to be loved, wanting to feel valuable and wanting to feel like you are a person with dignity. At the end of the day, if you are going to reduce prejudice, racism, sexism, war and selfishness you have understand that they come from the same psychology, that they come from the same human emotions and condition.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>What was it like attending <em>frank</em>?
</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">From the outside <em>frank</em> looks like it might be an utter train wreck of a conference. I have seen and been to so many other conferences that seem to promise exactly what frank is promising. That is: you’re going to have this discovery thing, you are going to have all these moments, it is going to be fun and entertaining, there is going to be a lip sync contest. I have seen that train wreck so many times. But, I was not expecting for <em>frank</em> to literally deliver exactly on the promise that it put out. That <em>frank</em> is going to provide you <em>frank</em> moment after moment after moment, and that it is as wonderfully intellectual as it is fun and emotional as it promises to be.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I think is really valuable about frank from an academic perspective or really any perspective is that it is both humbling and inspiring at the same time. It reminds you that what you do can only be so valuable, and that you need an army of people doing different things. You need the activist, you need the talented marketer and the savvy politician who actually has to do some unsavory things like make compromises and be realistic.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was amazing. <em>frank</em> is the place that helps you have the discussions that you need to have before you find out the answers to the questions you may have.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>Tell us about the moments you were able to connect with people.</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">People helped connect ideas in my head that I hadn’t connected. It really makes you think about your next project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The term we use at the University of Oregon is adjacent, someone not exactly in your field but not far enough away to not understand what you’re doing and your goals. That’s the beautiful thing about frank, it is not a bunch of crazily different people, it is a bunch of adjacent people interacting and those people are going to be able to give you feedback and ideas that are beneficial for you. They understand what you are going for, they think about the same stuff, but in a different way and can share that with you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>What was it like presenting at frank?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had the wonderful pleasure of going almost at the end of <em>frank</em>. I got to see how warm and responsive and wonderful the audience was. Whenever you go on stage you are kind of nervous. But I had seen from the reaction of the crowd and the twitter feed that if ever there was an audience that wanted to listen fully to what you had to say, this was the audience.  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was an absolute pleasure. I get nervous talking about my research a little bit, I get flustered talking about my personal experiences, but it felt like a very warm and comfortable experience. I am very glad that I got to go toward the end of the week so I could see that the audience would be on my side and that they would tweet at me and help me be a better version of my research and goals.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>How did it feel to win $10,000 <em>frank</em> research prize?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It felt really good. Whenever someone says something good is going to happen you think you are going to jump up and down with excitement. But when my name got said it was more of a feeling like “aww.”  Like frozen shock. Someone next to me had to shake me and say, “I think you have to go up there to get the prize.” It was like “it happened, this was awesome, people like me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>What was the first thing you did after you won?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing I did after I won was talk to different people who came up to me after. There were many research conversations that happened for the next three and half hours. After that I took a selfie in front of the Hippodrome and sent it to everyone who helped me on the project.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><strong>Awesome! Any last words?</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would say that academics worry often that if they go to conferences where there are practitioners that they will be wasting their time. <em>frank</em> is 100 percent not that way.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">My advice to future prize people: this is a conference you want to go to. You don’t just apply because you want to potentially win a prize. This is a conference you actually want to go to. The audience wants to hear about your research. They will be interested in hearing more details about your research after you finish your talk.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me say it this way, <em>frank</em> is full of the practitioners out there that you always knew existed, but never knew how to find. There they are. Go to <em>frank</em> and find them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Will This Strategy Finally Put an End to Sexual Assault on America's College Campuses?</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In a series of town halls with college and high school students about sexual assault, Joe Biden said the number one thing that needs to happen is getting men involved. “Two-thirds of college students say they have been sexually harassed,” but the strategy of telling men not to rape and telling women not to be raped is not an effective way to reduce this number. <a href="http://itsonus.org">It’s on Us</a> and <a href="https://www.livethegreendot.com">Green Dot</a> instead focus on bystander interventions – where the community takes charge of protecting each other from sexual assault.</span>

<a href="http://mic.com/articles/140523/will-this-strategy-finally-put-an-end-to-sexual-assault-on-america-s-college-campuses#.h8Xxg78fx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">.Mic</span></a>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Young Mothers Lose Two Years of Salary</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">April 12 marked Equal Pay Day, the symbolic day that recognizes the wage gap that exists in our country; however, a new study shows that there is an even larger wage gap for young mothers. The Danish National Patient Registry found that women who have children before they are 25 lose two years of their lifetime income. Pacific Standard say this disparity is a result of reduced hours after pregnancy and employer discrimination.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://psmag.com/young-mothers-lose-two-years-worth-of-salary-57a25c88aca8#.hjdog46su">Pacific Standard</a></span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Are We Laughing Alone?</span></h2>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Limits of the Late-Night Comedy Takedown</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Comedians like John Oliver and Samantha Bee are wielding the power of humor to take on tough political content in hopes of inspiring some form of change. But there are two major limits to these programs: they reach the wrong audience and they only create temporary interest. Adam Felder from the Atlantic points out that the audience of Last Week Tonight is almost all liberal, and the audience’s interest is short-lived because they already agree with the ideas that Oliver discusses. Humor is a great medium for social change, but these programs need to find a way to reach a different audience.</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to See Gentrification Coming</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Gentrification – the process of making neighborhoods more affluent usually at the expense of low-income families and small businesses – is an issue that impacts major urban areas around the world. Researchers from the University of Cambridge have found a way to map out which areas are most likely to be gentrified next by using social media like Twitter and Foursquare. They discovered that when a diverse group of outsiders begins to visit an area, that area is more likely to become gentrified in the long run.</span>

		<title>21 Ways to Tell a Nonprofit Story</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Many nonprofit stories take the form of online videos, but there are plenty of other forms. Consider the following examples for inspiration.

<strong>Oral history</strong>: The <a href="http://www.actuporalhistory.org/" target="_blank">ACT UP Oral History Project</a> documents the history of the AIDS activist group. The <a href="http://vanguardrevisited.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Vanguard Revisited</a> project enlisted homeless LGBTQ youth in San Francisco to document the history of their predecessors and take their own place in history. <a href="http://voiceofwitness.org/" target="_blank">Voice of Witness</a> produces books of oral histories on contemporary human-rights crises. Slave narratives recorded by the <a href="http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/snhtml/" target="_blank">Federal Writers’ Project</a> provided a training ground for socially conscious writers such as Zora Neale Hurston, Studs Terkel, and Richard Wright. <a href="http://www.oralhistoryforsocialchange.org/" target="_blank">Groundswell</a> is a network of people using oral history and narrative for movement-building and social change.<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/14.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-14430" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/14.jpg" alt="1" width="180" height="270" /></a>

<strong>Posters, plaques, stickers</strong>: The <a href="http://www.neighborhoodstoryproject.org/" target="_blank">Neighborhood Story Project</a> in New Orleans did <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/arts/the-neighborhood-story-project-at-the-fair-grounds-race-course.html" target="_blank">a series of open letters</a> from workers at the local racetrack, and a poster series about them as well. Some groups place historical markers, such as the series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_Walk" target="_blank">LGBT history plaques</a>in Chicago or artist Norm Magnusson’s political messages on official-looking <a href="http://www.funism.com/art/I75project.html" target="_blank">signs along Interstate 75</a>. College activists have also used <a href="http://mic.com/articles/115672/these-campus-activists-are-pushing-back-on-abortion-stigma-one-sticker-at-a-time" target="_blank">stickers that tell personal stories</a> to reduce abortion stigma.

<strong>Mobile story-mapping</strong>: <a href="http://www.mondobizarro.org/?page_id=15" target="_blank">I-Witness Central City</a>, a project of Mondo Bizarro in New Orleans, and the <a href="http://berkeleyplaques.org/" target="_blank">Berkeley Historical Plaque Project</a> place markers at historic sites from which passersby can dial a phone number to listen to a story about that site.

<strong>Story booths</strong>: In an initiative called <a href="http://thehivstoryproject.org/hsp/generations-hiv/" target="_blank">Generations HIV</a>, the <a href="http://thehivstoryproject.org/" target="_blank">HIV Story Project</a> set up a story-gathering booth at sites around the Bay Area. (Watch a short <a href="http://www.insidestoriesonline.com/2010/08/hiv-story-project-to-know-them-is-to.html" target="_blank">video</a> about the project.)

<strong>Walking tours and historical-site tours:</strong> During its 15 years of operation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mytown_(organization)" target="_blank">MYTOWN</a> trained nearly 400 Boston youth to create and lead historical walking tours. Though plantation tours are <a href="http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2015/07/plantation_tours_don_t_expect_to_hear_how_horrible_slavery_really_was.html" target="_blank">notoriously light on information about slaves</a>, some do focus on slavery, such as the <a href="http://www.whitneyplantation.com/" target="_blank">Whitney Plantation</a> in Louisiana.

Comic books:</strong> A Kenyan group called <a href="http://www.welltoldstory.net/" target="_blank">Well Told Story</a> produces comic books, radio dramas, and other media on issues such as HIV and agricultural practices. The United Nations is using <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/2169836/the-u-n-wants-to-change-the-world-by-2030-can-comics-help/" target="_blank">comic books</a> to build support for international development. In 1958, the <a href="http://forusa.org/blogs/for/order-martin-luther-king-comic-book-today-for-mlk-day-events/9955" target="_blank">Fellowship of Reconciliation</a> published a 16-page comic book called <a href="http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/the_montgomery_story_comic_book/" target="_blank">Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story</a>; an Arabic translation was used by <a href="http://daliaziada.blogspot.com/2009/05/can-comic-book-about-mlk-change-middle.html" target="_blank">Egyptian activists</a>before the Arab Spring as a point of departure for discussion about nonviolent social change.

<strong>Online museums</strong>: <a href="http://abhmuseum.org/" target="_blank">America’s Black Holocaust Museum</a> is a series of online exhibits about the history of lynching in the U.S. <a href="http://www.girlmuseum.org/" target="_blank">Girl Museum</a> presents online exhibitions, publications, and videos to advocate for girls as forces for change, “not as victims and consumers.”

<strong>Brick-and-mortar museums</strong>: The <a href="http://www.glbthistory.org/museum/" target="_blank">GLBT History Museum</a> in San Francisco tells stories on themes such as the struggle for self-determination.
<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-14428" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13.jpg" alt="1" width="300" height="221" />Traveling museums</strong>: The <a href="http://ciw-online.org/museum/" target="_blank">Florida Modern-Day Slavery Museum</a> is a cargo truck that contains displays on the history of slavery in Florida, up to as recent a case as 2008, with the abuse of farmworkers in the state; it has toured the Southeast and beyond.

<strong>Puppetry</strong>: One of the best-known groups to use puppetry for social change is <a href="http://breadandpuppet.org/" target="_blank">Bread and Puppet Theater</a>. Other groups include <a href="http://www.spiralq.org/" target="_blank">Spiral Q</a> in Philadelphia, <a href="http://www.wisefoolnewmexico.org/" target="_blank">Wise Fool New Mexico</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PuppetUnderground" target="_blank">Puppet Underground</a> in Washington, D.C. “<a href="http://witsendpuppets.com/2014/01/22/a-brief-history-of-puppets-and-social-justice/" target="_blank">A Brief History of Puppets and Social Justice</a>” is a good primer. <a href="http://www.sanrights.org/" target="_blank">Sanitation and Health Rights in India</a> works to end open defecation in that country; the first in a series of five videos about the group details <a href="http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/giveashit" target="_blank">a collaboration with a puppet theater company</a>.

<strong>Theater and shared scripts</strong>: <a href="http://www.elteatrocampesino.com/About/missionhistory.html" target="_blank">El Teatro Campesino</a> was founded in 1965 amid the grape strike of the United Farm Workers and performed <a href="http://www.library.ucsb.edu/special-collections/cema/etc" target="_blank">short skits in union halls and on flatbed trucks</a> to rally support for the cause. Some organizations make scripts available for community groups to put on their own performances, such as <a href="http://www.8theplay.com/" target="_blank">8</a>, a play about the debate over marriage equality based on the federal trial of California’s Prop. 8. <a href="http://cornerstonetheater.org/" target="_blank">Cornerstone Theater Company</a> in Los Angeles produces site-specific plays on themes such as hunger and the plight of day laborers.

<strong>Games:</strong> <a href="http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/publications/cops-rubbers" target="_blank">Cops &amp; Rubbers</a> is a table-top game by designer <a href="http://lienbtran.com/" target="_blank">Lien Tran</a> and funded by the Open Society Foundations that puts players in the shoes of sex workers in cities and countries worldwide where a condom is enough evidence of sex work to get you arrested or extorted. <a href="http://gamesforchange.org/" target="_blank">Games for Change</a> promotes games based on real-life social problems. The social-network game <a href="http://www.urgentevoke.com/" target="_blank">EVOKE</a> was a “10-week crash course in changing the world,” in which players in classrooms around the world generated ideas to real-world problems.

<strong>Transmedia: </strong>Projects such as the <a href="http://www.sandystoryline.com/" target="_blank">Sandy Storyline</a> tell personal stories through a combination of text, audio, photo, and video, humanizing overwhelming or seemingly abstract events. A sister project is <a href="http://housingisahumanright.org/" target="_blank">Housing Is a Human Right</a>, a creative storytelling project on housing and home.

<strong>Speaking tours, open mikes, and other live forms:</strong> <a href="http://themoth.org/" target="_blank">The Moth’s</a> open-mike “story slams” take place in more than a dozen U.S. cities and internationally, and they also provide <a href="http://themoth.org/about/programs/mothshop-community-education-program" target="_blank">community and education programs</a> for high school students and marginalized adults in New York City. Exhale sponsored a “<a href="https://exhaleprovoice.org/provoicetour" target="_blank">Pro-Voice</a>” speaking tour of college campuses for women to share their personal abortion experiences.

<strong>Music:</strong> What stories are more memorable than those told in song? Contemporary musicians with story-songs include <a href="http://jasirix.com/" target="_blank">Jasiri X</a> and <a href="http://www.toshireagon.com/" target="_blank">Toshi Reagon</a>. Classic songs that tell stories include Bob Dylan’s “<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/death-emmett-till" target="_blank">The Death of Emmett Till</a>” and “<a href="http://www.bobdylan.com/us/songs/hurricane" target="_blank">Hurricane</a>” and <a href="http://sweethoneyintherock.org/" target="_blank">Sweet Honey in the Rock’s</a> “<a href="http://www.songlyrics.com/sweet-honey-in-the-rock/ballad-of-the-broken-word-lyrics/" target="_blank">Ballad of the Broken Word</a>.”

<strong>Twitter and Facebook:</strong> It’s hard but not impossible to tell a story in a single Facebook post or 140-character tweet. Novelist <a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole/" target="_blank">Teju Cole</a> wrote “<a href="http://gawker.com/5976074/here-are-seven-very-short-stories-about-drones-by-award-winning-author-teju-cole" target="_blank">seven very short stories about drones</a>” on Twitter. Another Twitter story unfolded over the course of 33 re-tweets and was called “<a href="https://twitter.com/tejucole/timelines/437242785591078912" target="_blank">Hafiz</a>” (explained more on <a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/teju-cole-twitter/" target="_blank">Wired</a>).

<strong>Online publishing:</strong> <a href="http://www.wattpad.com/" target="_blank">Wattpad</a> and <a href="https://storify.com/" target="_blank">Storify</a> are web platforms for creating, reading, and sharing stories, from social-media collages to fan fiction to novels to serial stories. (Read this <a href="https://www.hatchforgood.org/explore/11/a-guide-to-storify" target="_blank">Hatch blog post</a> on how to make the best use of Storify.)

<strong>Reenactments:</strong> In his <a href="http://www.abladeofgrass.org/fellow/dread-scott/" target="_blank">Slave Rebellion Reenactment</a>, artist <a href="http://www.dreadscott.net/" target="_blank">Dread Scott</a> will reinterpret an 1811 uprising in the place where it happened. For her “<a href="http://www.jenniferkarady.com/soldier_stories1.html" target="_blank">Soldiers Stories</a>” project, photographer Jennifer Karady had American veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan re-create combat situations they experienced in war.

<strong>Journalism:</strong> <a href="http://renjournalism.org/" target="_blank">Renaissance Journalism</a> reimagines the media as a “vital source of education, engagement, and empowerment for underserved communities.” <a href="http://ivoh.org/" target="_blank">Images and Voices of Hope</a> promotes “media as agents of world benefit,” and the <a href="http://solutionsjournalism.org/" target="_blank">Solutions Journalism Network</a> encourages journalists to cover responses to social problems. The <a href="http://globalpressinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Global Press Institute</a> trains women in developing countries as journalists, publishes their stories in the organization’s own Global Press Journal, and syndicates them via their Global Press News Service; read a <a href="https://philanthropy.com/article/Nonprofits-Can-Learn-From/151945" target="_blank">story about the group</a> in the <em>Chronicle of Philanthropy</em>.

<strong>Documentary and fiction film:</strong> Years’ worth of documentary film exists on virtually every social cause. Groups like <a href="http://activevoice.net/" target="_blank">Active Voice Lab</a>, <a href="http://workingfilms.org/" target="_blank">Working Films</a> and the <a href="http://www.sundance.org/support/storiesofchange" target="_blank">Stories of Change</a> partnership work with media-makers, funders, community groups, and others to link those films to social-change movements.

<strong>Radio:</strong> <a href="https://youthradio.org/" target="_blank">Youth Radio</a> trains young people from diverse backgrounds in digital media and technology and distributes their stories through major media outlets. And <a href="http://www.outloudradio.org/" target="_blank">outLoud Radio</a> gives “LGBTQ and ally youth the skills and confidence to represent themselves.”

<h2>Life Will Never be the Same</h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé's 'Lemonade' Is What Happens When Black Women Control Their Art</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Beyoncé’s new visual album “Lemonade” is amazing because it is honest, passionate and incredibly moving. “Lemonade” is special because a black woman had control over how her story was told. Jamilah King points out the contrast between the excellency of Beyoncé’s visual album and the travesty that was “Nina,” a biopic about Nina Simone released a day before “Lemonade.” The key lesson from this contrast is that women and minorities should be the ones telling their own stories because they are the ones who actually live it.</span>

<h2>Creating Empathy</h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Studio 360</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Virtual Reality takes film to a new level, where empathy and immersion fuse, resulting in a product that can deeply impact viewers. We VR – pronounced “weaver” – is a VR production company based in Los Angeles that focuses on using 360 degree films and video games to tell stories. Despite its similarities to film, VR poses many challenges for filmmakers, including editing, lighting and blocking. Andrew Marantz explores We VR’s process and problem solving through some of the narratives they are creating.</span>

<h2>The Future of the Good Fight</h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, There Really is Scientific Consensus on Climate Change </span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">97 percent of scientists agree that humans the cause climate change. Despite this consensus, many public figures that oppose climate action dismiss the consensus by using fake experts. This misinformation is furthered when the media creates a false-balance of information, equating the 97 percent and 3 percent. Climate communication scholar John Cook suggests that climate communicators should fight misinformation by emphasizing scientific consensus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://thebulletin.org/yes-there-really-scientific-consensus-climate-change9332">Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</a></span>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conservation in the Age of Climate Change: Why Scientists Are Banking on Drones for Tracking Coastal Climate Research</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the technology has existed for years, drones are becoming more and more popular. Climate scientists are using drones to make data collection easier in coastal regions. While drones are not perfect, the information they provide is helping scientists see the day-to-day effects of climate change.</span>

<h2>Engage the Ego</h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-affirmation Changes Health Behavior</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">People have unhealthy habits, and they continue to live an unhealthy lifestyle when told that it’s bad for them. Self-affirmation theory explains that people are often defensive about their health behavior and choices to maintain self-integrity. However, studies have found that making people feel good about themselves (self-affirmation) leads many to change their behavior for the better. </span>

<h2>How Nonprofits Win</h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Social Media Effectiveness for Public Engagement: An Example of Small Nonprofits</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">When small activist nonprofits use social media, they have to take into consideration what audience they want to reach and what action they want them to take. Small nonprofits work to engage different stakeholders on social media to meet three goals: to disseminate information about their causes and organization, to build community and engage and to mobilize actions like donating or volunteering. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Dozens of nonprofit organizations - like Connected for Good, Close the Gap, and EveryoneOn - are working to bridge the gap between those who do and do not have access to the Internet. Cost, accessibility and a lack of digital literacy are keeping people offline, cost being the biggest of the three. People at EveryoneOn are working on scanning ISPs throughout the country and finding or negotiating deals to bring prices down.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Researchers are exploring the science of practice to understand how we can maximize our growth in our craft. They argue </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">purposeful practice – thoughtful and focused practice– rather than routine practice can help us dramatically improve.</span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Inside Story Of How 4 Courageous Reporters Freed More Than 2,000 Slaves</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Four reporters discovered a slave island in a remote Indonesian village, where the workers were forced to fish 20 hours a day for little to no pay. They used satellite data to track the fishing orders and eventually proved that fish was ending up in the United States. As a result of their reporting, more than 2,000 captives were set free and the Associated Press won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. </span>

		<title>Why I Am a frank Scholar</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/05/14453/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">As someone who is passionate about what she does and knows, I am in awe that any person asks me to participate on a panel, asks me to comment on their work, or invites me to be a part of a conference. When Dr. Linda Hon asked for me to participate in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(scholar), I said yes without a pause and without knowing what I was getting into. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later, when I saw the impressive list of international scholars who would speak and when I learned that we had to do a TED like talk, I didn’t feel the terror just the excitement. This was a different type of conference. The conference language affirmed that. This was a place where scholars with like minds could challenge, discuss and promote their ideas. As an isolated scholar of color in a department without colleagues who share research interests, I needed an intellectual oasis like</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(scholar) in the middle of my semester. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">My conference talk focused on connecting the dots within my research and to the research of other scholars attending the conference. Little did I know that as I prepared my presentation and played many games of Dots that I would launch a project that blended my research, my budding innovation and entrepreneurial interest and my concerns for underrepresented PR students. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Once upon a time, I had a blog centering on diversity and public relations, The Requisite Variety. According to the Wayback Time Machine, the blog started in 2009. One of the first original posts outlined the goals of the site: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">a blog to discuss ideas, topics and research related to difference in public relations practice. Now is the time, and although I may be the primary author, all of us have a chance to contribute to the discussions of diversity.”</span>

I knew that I wanted to do something bigger, but my time and talent became wrapped up with tenure and job success.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I mentioned this idea of The Requisite Variety as a hub to connect students and practitioners at</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(scholar), I thought it would be an offhand remark. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who was I, a regular academic with a lot of papers and theories, to do something like this? And who could I partner with to get this off the group? What group of people could help me launch this idea and help with outreach, logistics and planning?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I received my answer after I stepped off the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(scholar) stage. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">At that conference, I received warm, enthusiastic feedback from the scholars and a willingness from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to help with the launch. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Without the help of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to get this idea out of my head and off the ground, I would still be thinking and trying to connect the dots.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;"> February 2016 saw the relaunch of </span><a href="http://therequisitevariety.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Requisite Variety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as a blog and as an information repository. Inspired by </span><a href="http://diversify.journalismwith.me"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2020 Shift and Diversify Journalism With Me</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I wanted to do the same thing for PR with </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Requisite Variety, a database initiative to assist students and practitioners of color who are seeking job and professional development opportunities and to assist hiring managers and HR leaders in PR find diverse candidates. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the intentions for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(scholar) is to be an incubator for great ideas and initiatives, and I am pleased to be the first </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">scholar to launch a public communication-facing project. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you, Dr. Hon for the request for me to speak, and thank you to <em>frank</em>(scholar) for helping me turn my passionate cause into a reality. </span>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Continuing the Fight for LGBT Equality: A Conversation with Anastasia Khoo</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/05/14465/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">In 2015 we saw enormous progress in the fight for LGBT rights with the Supreme Court ruling for marriage equality and the introduction of the Equality Act in Congress. As we've moved into 2016, we've seen a backlash against human rights in the South with the introduction of bills that allow for discrimination against LGBT people on the basis of religious freedom and privacy rights.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The introduction of bills like<a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/05/09/477316001/deadline-approaches-for-north-carolinas-response-on-lgbt-law"> HB 2</a> (better known as the bathroom bill) and <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/04/05/473107959/mississippi-governor-signs-religious-freedom-bill-into-law">HB 1523</a> (better known as the religious freedom bill that would allow businesses to deny services to LGBT people based on religious beliefs) in states across the south have led to court battles and boycotts. For example, following the passage of HB 2 in North Carolina, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/04/when-musicians-boycott-to-protest-politics/477861/">musicians</a> like Bruce Springsteen and Demi Lovato have canceled shows in solidarity with the LGBT community. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ceos-north-carolina-lgbt-law_us_56faeb83e4b0a06d5803e81d">Businesses</a> like Bank of America, Uber, Facebook, Airbnb and more have all pledged to take their business out of North Carolina.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The U.S. Justice Department is now suing North Carolina, Governor Pat McCrory and the University of North Carolina for violating the U.S. Civil Rights Act, arguing the bill is in violation of Title IX, which prevents sex discrimination at public schools, Title VII, which protects public employees from discrimination and the Violence Against Women Act.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In a press conference, Attorney General Loretta Lynch said "This is not the first time that we have seen discriminatory responses to historic moments of progress for our nation. We saw it in the Jim Crow laws that followed the Emancipation Proclamation. We saw it in fierce and widespread resistance to <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em>. And we saw it in the proliferation of state bans on same-sex unions intended to stifle any hope that gay and lesbian Americans might one day be afforded the right to marry." She went on to say "It was not so very long ago that states, including North Carolina, had signs above restrooms, water fountains and on public accommodations keeping people out based upon a distinction without a difference. We have moved beyond those dark days, but not without pain and suffering and an ongoing fight to keep moving forward."</p>
<p dir="ltr">In response, the North Carolina Governor has filed his own lawsuit against the DOJ claiming they are in breach of <a href="https://fusion.net/wp-admin/post.php?post=300113&amp;action=edit">federal overreach.</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Clearly the fight for human rights is not over.</p>
<p dir="ltr">As a big player in the movement for LGBT equality, the <a href="http://www.hrc.org">Human Rights Campaign</a> (HRC) is using all the tools they have to stop these discriminatory bills. From organizing celebrities and business leaders, to leading marches in the street, HRC is on the frontline of this fight. I talked with Anastasia Khoo, chief marketing officer for HRC and the brain behind many of their well known and successful social media campaigns about the fight and what HRC is doing to win.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you tell us what you are currently working on?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I am working on building the public engagement strategy around many of the anti-LGBT bills in the states across the country. This year we have been monitoring nearly 200 anti-LGBT bills in 36 states. So, it has been a very busy couple of months for us, not only monitoring those bills, but actively mobilizing our members and supporters to stop those bills.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What sort of things are you doing to reach those goals?</strong></p>
As an organization we’ve applied our field strategy which is mobilizing everyday citizens to stand up, whether it is a rally or a march to the state capital from the Governor's mansion in Mississippi, having people sign action alerts, mobilizing business leaders of major companies across the country to stand up against the bill, asking celebrities to speak out, or organizing on social media. We are using everything in our toolbox to ensure that many of the bills are defeated. And we’ve been successful. With many state legislatures now adjourned for the year, we are down to around 30 bills now, which is a huge margin given this is the year we have seen an unprecedented number of anti-LGBT bills introduced.
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you tell me a more about your campaign tactics to work with business leaders and celebrities?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">There is a whole range of things that go into a campaign. We can’t discount the power influencers have. People are attuned, whether they follow them on social or see a news article about one of their favorite celebrities. It occupies a really powerful place in this country's consciousness. It is a strategy that has worked for us in the past. We saw a lot of success around that in the marriage equality campaign. We have been fortunate that so many individuals have continued to speak out on this issue.</p>
<p dir="ltr">On the business front, what has been really exciting is the business community has really rallied behind this, not only because it is the right thing to do, but it also just makes really good business sense. It fits with the policy and practices that the businesses have in their own companies and it speaks to attracting and attaining the talent when you have inclusive policies.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I think that those two pillars have been really powerful for us in this fight and certainly in issues that we have waged in the past.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>In your mind why are we seeing an increase in these anti-LGBT bills?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We have experienced unprecedented success and very quickly as a movement. I think back to when I first started at the Human Rights Campaign 10 years ago and it was a very different cultural and political landscape on our issues. We’ve seen rapid progress, especially with the Supreme Court ruling last year that granted marriage equality nationwide, it really was an incredible achievement. I do think the increase we have seen in anti-LGBT bills in the state legislatures is a direct result of that progress. In so many ways I think that it is just a backlash to the success that we have had as a movement and the visibility.</p>
<p dir="ltr">The anti-LGBT bills that we are seeing in North Carolina and Mississippi are really about the fundamentals around discrimination. One of the keys to our success as a movement has been LGBT coming out. Coming out for transgender people is much more risky, there is fear of losing their jobs and housing, there's still no federal bill that protects LGBT people, particularly trans people who are among some of the most vulnerable in the community. We have worked so hard as an organization and a movement to empower people to come out and speak their truth, not only to their friends and family, but to their coworkers and neighbors.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What  do you see the role of coming out is in your work and the movement?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Visibility has been so key to our success. I think that’s where we saw, in marriage equality, real rapid increase of acceptance around the issue. It was no longer someone you saw on television, it was someone you knew, and more often than not someone that you really loved.  Then you understood that they just wanted the same things that you had in terms of having a family and to be able to be married to the person you loved.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Really, we are working to raise awareness of the challenges transgender people face in this country, and I think a lot of progress has been made, particularly around people coming out and knowing more trans people. But, we still have a long way to go.<span class="im">
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What are your next challenges?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are certainly in big fights in North Carolina and Mississippi to repeal these laws. While we have defeated a lot of other bills, it is still going to be an intense couple of months to achieve victory. Beyond that, we are really focused on a federal bill called The Equality Act that would  prevent discrimination on a host of issues. Achieving that would mean we are no longer fighting these state by state battles around discrimination. That is the long game.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In the meantime, we are continuing to use the tactics that have worked for us, including visibility, mobilizing our members and supporters, reaching out to business leaders and influencers to continue to pressure these governors and senate and house leaders in these states to do the right thing and repeal these bills.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you use research in your work?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Certainly, that is an important component. In everything we do, we use message testing  to make sure we are using the right message. It is expensive, but I certainly think that the work that not just we’ve done, but others in the movement have done, has really helped to inform how to talk about things. I wish we had the time and money to be doing more, because I do believe in the value of it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We do message testing, we do a lot of polls, and from time to time we will do focus groups. It depends on the campaign and the case and what we are working on, but we have employed all different methods around many of our issues.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What role can the field of public interest communications play in the LGBT fight and movement?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Many people assumed that because we had such an incredible victory around marriage equality that it was done and that people could move on to other issues. But what we have seen is that is not the case. Just because the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality doesn’t mean that we have outlawed homophobia and transphobia. So I think our challenge is to galvanize people to help them understand that discrimination still exists and that our work isn’t done. Continuing the drumbeat on our issues will continue as these bills play out in these states.<span class="im">
</span></p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the role of strategic communications in achieving those goals?</strong></p>
Strategic communications is often on the front lines. At the Human Rights Campaign we are all about the rapid response mechanism that we have built here over the years and continuing to implement the best practices that we have learned in order to win. I would say that we are both the strategist and also the implementers which at times can be a really hard thing to do. In that respect, I often think of our team as being on the front lines of our fights.

<strong>What are some of the best practices you have learned?</strong>
<p dir="ltr">Our success has really been built on – from my perspective in the marketing department – a strategy of response. Our audience attune themselves to us having a point of view on all these issues. Even though we are a multi-issue advocacy organization, I think we have inserted ourselves into the dialogue that has been happening around the country and around the world. We are constantly looking for ways to insert our point of view into whatever is happening, and i think that has been really successful for us.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Second, we really believe that digital and social is not an afterthought, it really is at the forefront of our work.  We have seen a lot of success in this approach. We have been able to utilize that to not only raise awareness, but achieve social change. What we often say is that we are not just in the business of marketing our issues, but we are really in the business of changing hearts and minds.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>HRC is known for using social media unlike any other organization, through your use of Facebook icons and buy now buttons on Twitter. How are you using social media now in addressing the new anti-LGBT bills?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We are still continuing to use it to help elevate the issue and beat the drum on these issues. We are using it in very targeted ways and are using it in a way to bring the fight directly to people.</p>
For example, over the weekend in Mississippi we implemented  a lot of the Facebook live features, so you can be at a rally. We are bringing it to you. We have also done that in the past on Periscope.  We are also very active on Snapchat. We were one of the first organizations to have a partnership with Snapchat and we are seeing incredible engagement. We are just snapping everywhere we go. These battles certainly lend themselves to these on the ground perspectives.
<p dir="ltr"><strong>What should we look forward to seeing from HRC in the future?</strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">We have a very full plate ahead of us. We have all of these bills that are still in play. We have the one year anniversary of marriage equality which we are really looking forward to celebrating. The one year anniversary of the introduction of the Equality Act in Congress and looking to build visibility around that moment. And certainly the presidential elections. We have seen the power of having a pro-equality president in office, and we look forward to electing the next president to help continue the policies and the progress we have seen under the Obama administration. We have a really big agenda and full plate ahead of us for 2016.</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Word from a Few Scientists</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stop Saying ‘I Feel Like’</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The phrase “I feel like” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">says a lot about our current ideas around reason, emotion and argument. It </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">is often used in discussions around social and scientific issues and politics. What seems like a simple conversation starter is actually a way to express what you think without refutation. </span>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/opinion/sunday/stop-saying-i-feel-like.html?smprod=nytcore-ipad&amp;smid=nytcore-ipad-share&amp;_r=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times</span></a>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How to Counteract Climate Change Inaction and Denial</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though more people today believe climate change is real, many still disagree on solutions. One study out of the University of California-San Diego found that emphasizing our collective responsibility to protect the environment is much more effective than focusing on the individual actions. In a second study, published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, researchers suggest that many people are determined to defend and protect the status quo.</span>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 Winning Business Strategies For Environmentalists, From The Experts At Patagonia</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Patagonia company is part clothing supplier, part environmental action group. It gives away 1% of its net sales to nonprofits every year and organizes conferences to trains activists in business. Now, the talks and skills from these conferences have been compiled into a book, </span><a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/product/tools-for-grassroots-activists-paperback-book?p=BK740-0"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tools for Grassroots Activists</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some of the major lessons from the guide are on communications, strategy, fundraising, lobbying and working with businesses. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Jane Jacobs Changed the Way We Look at Cities</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Journalist, author and activist Jane Jacobs has spent her life study and advocating for cities. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the 100th anniversary of her birth, The Guardian takes a look at how Jacobs radically altered how we look at and design cities. Jane Jacobs wanted us to see the city in a deeper, more complex way, and consider the lives of the various communities within urban settings.</span>

		<title>NPR Wants To Know If It’s Possible to Measure How Much People Care</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/05/14476/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[What’s the point of journalism? That’s a question Brian Boyer has taken deeply to heart. As the Visuals Editor of NPR, he’s been hard at work for the last six months on a project called <a href="http://thecarebot.github.io/about/">Carebot</a>, which tracks how well news stories drive audiences to take action and aims to “change how newsrooms measure and celebrate success.”

Carebot was funded through a <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/grants/201551645/">Knight Foundation Prototype Grant</a>, which is now wrapping up. I talked with Brian about what his team has learned – in the business of making people care.

&nbsp;

<strong>Sacha: What are you measuring with the Carebot right now?</strong>

Brian: We’ve played around with a lot of different metrics – the “linger rate” with a graphic, how many people read a story all the way to the end, Facebook shares per pageview. Carebot is not a set formula. It’s more of a framework for how you look at your analytics.What’s most important is to first define what success means to you. On the Visuals Team, we decided that we believe that journalism has the power to make people care. So we tried to measure that in a variety of different ways. But this goal has been isolated to our team. NPR’s Visuals team is a small group of technologists who work within the newsroom. So we really like to experiment. Other NPR desks and news organizations will – and should – have a different definition of success.

&nbsp;

<strong>S: It sounds like you're trying to move past the traditional journalistic metric of page views. </strong>

B: Page views is a metric that’s intended to serve the needs of online advertising. Really, all of Google Analytics is set up that way, because Google is an advertiser.For us, a pageview is an indication of intent. The reader clicks and says, “I might be interested in that.” But we want to know what the reader does from there.

&nbsp;

<strong>S: It's interesting that Carebot delivers analytics directly to your reporters about how their stories perform. Has this had any effect on their reporting – even just to provoke discussion?</strong>

B: Some news organizations have chosen not to send performance statics to their reporters. Famously, the New York Times doesn’t do this. I understand why they would want to keep certain numbers out of the newsroom. They don’t reflect journalistic quality; they reflect the fact that people are interested in cats and celebrities.But it’s also totally insane to say, “Hey newsroom: act in a vacuum.” Really, it’s about the communication. After you’ve agreed on how you want to measure success, you can celebrate it in a shared team space.Practically, we’ve seen a few things happen since we started sharing metrics with reporters:
<ol>
	<li><strong>Happier teams</strong> – Reporters are like, “Holy crap, people are reading my thing!”</li>
	<li><strong>Adjusting how we work</strong> – We’ve staffed up and down in certain ways. For example, we had a lot more evidence that we needed to hire more graphic designers.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;

<strong>S: You mentioned in a recent talk at the frank gathering that one story that performed surprisingly well with Carebot was an <a href="http://apps.npr.org/lookatthis/posts/yemen/">extended look at the civil war on Yemen</a>. What have you learned from this and other stories about the kinds of visuals that do – and don't– work? </strong>

B: Yeah, that Yemen story was incredible. About 60 percent of people completed the story – one of our highest. It was a long and difficult story. But people cared about it. We copied the shape of that story down the road.Another thing we changed was of often we “change modes.” What I mean by that is: early on, a common trend in “multimedia storytelling” was one big package, with a long body of text, slideshow, and audio. But when we looked at the completion rates of that kind of stories, we realized that – as soon as you changed modes (from text to video, for example) people would leave.Now we avoid switching modes, and if we do switch, we’re really careful about it. Take a look at this story about <a href="http://apps.npr.org/life-after-death/">Ebola in Liberia</a>. As you flip through the slides, there’s only ambient sound. If there is any narrative audio, it’s subtitled.

&nbsp;

<strong>S: So what is next for Carebot?</strong>

B: We hope other news organizations will find it useful. We recently participated in a Mozilla Open News event where news outlets hacked the code. The Texas Tribune also recently tested it out.Our primary goal right now is to make Carebot more modular, so it’s easier to build your own metric in Carebot. So for example, if a news organization wants to measure comments per pageview, we’d make it easier for to build plugins. We’re finishing up process guides and <a href="https://thecarebot.github.io/getting-started-with-Carebot/">instructions</a> for that right now.My dream scenario would be to have an open source, WordPress-type community around Carebot. The code is all <a href="https://github.com/nprapps/carebot">on Github</a>. Setting up Carebot is pretty easy for a technologist. It takes less than a day to fire up. The much harder thing is figuring out what you want to measure. Of course, it was harder for us to make Carebot open source. But part of the mission of public radio is to be a public service. Carebot won’t have a long, wonderful life unless other people contribute to it.

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">N.C.’s Transgender Skirmish Is Just The Latest in a Long History of Bathroom Freakouts:</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The issue of public bathrooms in North Carolina is heating up, with the Justice Department suing the state. However, this isn’t the first time politics have taken over the powder room. Mother Jones outlines the historic fight over public bathrooms. </span>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why isn’t Social Media a Reliable Tool for Social Change?</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many social movement campaigns have launched on social media and gone viral. However, political activists find it hard to use social media to create action. Social media data can predict the spread of ideas online, but it can’t predict changes in people’s behavior. </span>

<h2><strong>Who Can Come Out</strong></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Psychological Benefits of Verbally Coming Out</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">For some gay men, coming out to their parents could significantly improve their lives. Most researchers think that verbally saying “I’m gay” is essential to identity development and can boost self-esteem and well-being. However, new research suggests this</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> only applies to white gay men. Coming out fosters a healthy gay identity for some along ethnic lines.</span>

<h2>Insecurity Makes Us Silent on Climate Change</h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Vicious Cycle that Makes People Afraid to Talk About Climate Change</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Research shows that people don’t talk about climate change because they think their peers are more doubtful than they actually are. In other words, they silence themselves because they think they’ll be ridiculed. </span>

<h2>Why We are Obsessed with Storytellers</h2>

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps There’s a Reason ‘Storyteller’ Became a Twitter-Bio Cliche</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The word ‘storyteller’ appears in 48,234 Twitter bios. A paper published in Personal Relationships explains why we are obsessed with storytelling. The authors argue that people respect storytellers because being a good storyteller implies a “higher perceptions of status.” </span>

		<title>Could “Solutions Journalism” Be the Next Big Thing For Nonprofits?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">This year’s </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>frank</em> Gathering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> presented a smorgasbord of remarkable communications efforts intended to serve the public interest. One of my favorites was “solutions journalism” (dubbed “SoJo”).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the term was new to me, it struck a deep chord: for a long time I’ve wanted to see journalists report social solutions with the same attention and rigor that is typically reserved for investigating social ills. Furthermore, I’ve long thought that nonprofits can learn from these types of stories – and should try to pitch them more often.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In her informal <em>frank</em> session, </span><a href="http://journalism.uoregon.edu/member/thier_kathryn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathryn Their</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> shared the axiom that, “in a newsroom excessive cynicism is a misdemeanor, but excessive gullibility is a felony.” Indeed, it’s true that – from muckraking to watchdog journalism – the culture of the fourth estate tends to focus on exposing problems.</span>

However, as news outlets explore new types of storytelling in the digital realm, many are asking whether the journalist’s position on action needs to change. Likewise, more traditional news outlets are taking a closer look at the ideas and programs that could offer great promise to our society.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathryn is currently wrapping up her first semester at the University of Oregon teaching one of the country’s first university courses entirely devoted to solutions journalism. (Other programs exist at Temple University, Kent State University, Arizona State University, and Texas State University.) I caught up with her after the frank conference to discuss recent developments in her field.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Sacha: Just to set the table, what is solutions journalism?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Kathryn: The </span><a href="http://www.solutionsjournalism.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Solutions Journalism Network</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> defines it as, “rigorous and compelling reporting about responses to social problems.” In order to be considered solutions journalism, four qualities must be present:</span>
<ol>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How and why something is working</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Strong evidence that something is working</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insight into how solution could be applied elsewhere</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Limitations – Obviously, one solution won’t work everywhere, and you need to be honest about that</span></li>
</ol>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to note that solutions journalism is a practice, not a movement. Really, it’s just using all the traditional practices of journalism, with a different frame.</span>

<strong>Is solutions journalism a new phenomenon, or did it grow out of an older tradition in journalism?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s both. Civic journalism was a movement in the ’80s, as journalists began to ask, “What are the effects of negative reporting on society?” Today there are a lot of different ideas bubbling up like “</span><a href="http://ivoh.org/restorativenarrative/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">restorative narratives</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">,” and “</span><a href="http://constructivejournalism.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">constructive journalism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” What’s new about solutions journalism is an effort to legitimize and codify certain newsroom practices.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Do you see any resistance out there to solutions journalism?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I worked in a newsroom, it felt like reporting on what’s going right was not allowed – unless it was a saccharine feature. Of course, not every story should use solutions journalism. But if we’re not reporting on what’s going right in the world, how are we giving the public all the information it needs?</span>

Still, I think newsrooms are becoming more open to solutions journalism. Particularly with the digital revolution, audiences are showing that they want to engage.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I teach solutions journalism, I ask students to think about: “What is the role of the journalist in society?” I will tell them about solutions journalism, but I want them to decide for themselves whether it’s the right approach.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>What evidence do you see of the public's appetite for this type of journalism?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s some really interesting research on this topic. The Solutions Journalism Network and the Engaging News Project partnered on a </span><a href="http://engagingnewsproject.org/research/solutions-journalism/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which suggests that this kind of reporting does engage audiences differently. I’m about to start my own research project on this topic too.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>Personally, what go you interested in solutions journalism?</strong>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">When I was a reporter at the Charlotte Observer, I worked on a story about seven African-American teenagers who died in a car crash. We really tried to determine if the police officers erred and even re-created the teenagers’ last night.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We ultimately concluded that the police officer didn’t break any rules, but that the rules were outdated. This stimulated a lot of debate in the community. It was a very searing experience for me. I really began to question: what are we doing as journalists?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later I wrote a story about a local barber. He was also a playwright and put on a play for the community, which basically said that the crash was everyone’s fault and that everyone was also absolved of any wrongdoing. When I wrote about this – the Letter to the Editor totally changed. People were struck by it.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Later I discovered the New York Times’ blog </span><a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/category/fixes/?_r=0"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fixes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the work of Tina Rosenberg and David Bornstein – who helped to found the Solutions Journalism Network. I was like, “Wow, this is what I love.” I really felt like this is how journalists can provide better information to society.</span>

&nbsp;

<strong>What are a few of the best examples of solutions journalism you've seen recently?</strong>
<ul>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corpus Christi Caller-Times did a series called “</span><a href="http://www.caller.com/news/behind-broken-doors/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Behind Broken Doors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” about domestic violence.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Fayetteville Observer’s “</span><a href="http://www.fayobserver.com/special/seeking_safety/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seeking Safety</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” series looked at how 10 cities are fighting crime.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The New York Times </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/06/science/colorados-push-against-teenage-pregnancies-is-a-startling-success.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrote about</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> how Colorado cut teen pregnancy rate with long acting birth control.</span></li>
	<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Seattle Times’ Education Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has also done great work.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2><b>We’re Coming for You, Sugar</b></h2>

<h3><b></b><strong>Finally You Can See How Much Added Sugar Is Hidden in Your Food</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The FDA has changed the requirements for nutrition labels. N</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ew updates include highlighting the calorie count and an added sugar label. Sugar can’t hide in your food anymore. </span>

<h3><strong>How Typography Can Save Your Life</strong></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, the National Weather Service announced that they will no longer use all caps for forecasts and warnings. Using all caps unintentionally signified an emergency that people learned to ignore. This isn’t the first time typeface has been life-changing; it has been changed on road signs and display screens in cars to make drivers safer.  </span>

<h3><b>Whose Story Are We Telling?</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the closing keynote of Stanford Review’s conference, Andrew Means, cofounder of The Impact Lab, talked about using storytelling to raise funds and motivate people. If you share emotional stories – rather than sharing data – people are more likely to give. </span>

<h3><b>Portland Bans Climate-Denying Textbooks From Its Schools</b></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">The Portland Public Schools board voted against using textbooks that don’t face the reality of climate change. This is a step in the right direction of climate change education, which is still lacking in other parts of the country. Places like New York City are adapting to include climate change in its curriculum as well. </span>

</em>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IcVyvg2Qlo">It Gets Better Project’s</a> video aimed at inspiring hope in young people facing harassment sparked a viral revolution, garnering more than 50,000 video submissions and 50 million collective views. It's also credited with a 50 percent increase in phone calls to the Trevor Project’s suicide prevention hotline, saving countless lives.

Stories have the power to inform, inspire and spark change. Successful films – whether <a href="http://www.justlabelit.org/right-to-know-center/moms-for-gmo-labeling/">five-minute videos</a> asking mothers to support GMO labeling or feature-length documentaries like “<a href="http://www.blackfishmovie.com/">Blackfish</a>” – connect viewers to characters and can motivate audiences to take action. Videos that are coupled with a campaign or media strategy and provide clear opportunities for viewers to get involved have an even higher likelihood of creating positive change.

An inspiring video can enliven a campaign in progress or spark a new one. Here are some points to think about if your organization is considering getting behind the camera.
<ol>
	<li>Can you make Malcolm Gladwell proud? Could a video push legislation or a grassroots campaign past the tipping point? You don’t always have to think big. A well-crafted story could be influential at the local level, by influencing state government, a corporation, a city council or a school board. “<a href="http://endoftheline.com/">The End of the Line</a>,” a nine-minute film meant to raise awareness about over-fishing, created a tipping point in corporate policy. Many household names from Pret a Manger restaurants to Whiskas cat food switched to sustainable sources of fish, attributing the change in policy to this film.</li>
	<li>Are your characters relatable? When viewers identify with a character, they often see themselves in that character’s shoes. Identification with characters is critical to changing beliefs and behaviors of your audience. Nuance is important. Relatable and persuasive characters act within a spectrum, not in extremes. BuzzFeed got this right in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bei7vlf56w">viral video</a>about the poor quality of prison food, in which some of the actors reacted by spitting it out, yet others said that the food isn’t so bad. BuzzFeed succeeded by including reactions that viewers could imagine their friends having.</li>
	<li>How does your video translate into action? Think about who has the power to affect change on your issue and what messages will speak to them. What does this audience need to do? It’s important to think profoundly about the social action you want them to take – presenting an audience with an easy yet ineffective solution could hurt the issue if people consider their part done. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iIkOi3srLo">Follow the Frog</a>,” a clever video from the Rainforest Alliance, urges viewers to take meaningful and manageable action to help preserve the rainforest.</li>
	<li>Who makes the video? Once you’ve decided that making a short video or issue film is the right tactic to move the needle on your issue, you likely will need help to bring your idea to fruition. <a href="http://www.wirewalkerstudios.com/about-us/">Wire Walker Studios</a> (whose founders I met at this year’s <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frank2016/"><em>frank</em></a> conference) is an example of a production company that creates meaningful and entertaining films, both short and feature-length. The two founders believe that story-driven media can spark a conversation, inspire people to take action and create beneficial change. Their video “<a href="http://www.wirewalkerstudios.com/three-dreams/">Three Dreams</a>” manages to surprise and inspire the audience in less than three minutes.</li>
	<li>Filming is over – now what? Will your allies promote the video through their channels? Will you target audiences through paid advertising? Will you conduct media outreach? Will you host an event? You’ll need to think about the various elements involved in release and distribution to ensure that your video or film is seen by the appropriate audiences.</li>
</ol>
If you want to use film to advance a campaign but don’t want to make your own, you will benefit from Spitfire’s new project, <a href="http://andaction.org/">AndACTION.</a> This pop culture hub offers nonprofits inside intel on upcoming and recent film and TV storylines on specific issues. We hunt down leads and suggest creative ways nonprofits can use them to reach new audiences.

What we see on TV and in the movies affects how we feel about issues and the way we talk about them. Characters from “Jane the Virgin,” “Modern Family” and “Black-ish” help make immigration, marriage equality and racial justice feel less hypothetical – and more like real issues facing our friends. Simply put, pop culture is an untapped tool that can drive culture shifts.

The storylines we collect will be housed on AndACTION’s website, set to launch in early June. You will be able to sign up for email alerts to learn when upcoming film and TV shows cover your top issues. This way, you can move eyeballs from the big and small screen to your action page, making it easy to reach more people than ever before. Want to know more? Connect with <a href="emailto:justine@andaction.org">Justine Hebron </a>, AndACTION’s communications manager.  <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1645" src="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ACTION-IMAGE-1-270x300.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 163px) 100vw, 163px" srcset="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ACTION-IMAGE-1-270x300.jpg 270x, http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ACTION-IMAGE-1.jpg 438x" alt="ACTION IMAGE 1" width="163" height="181" />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr"><em>By Alexandra Booth, frank social media strategist</em></p>

<h2 dir="ltr">The Politics of Viralability</h2>

<hr />

<h3 dir="ltr">Here Are The Feels That Make Internet Things Go Viral</h3>
<p dir="ltr">We all wonder what makes one story go viral versus another. Turns out the way stories make us feel plays an important role. In a recent study, researchers examined what caused popular web stories to go viral.  They found stories that make people feel empowered and in control are more likely to be shared. Stories that leave people excited or upset are more likely to receive comments.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/05/emotions-linked-to-virality.html" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/05/emotions-linked-to-virality.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1465326769528000&amp;usg=AFQjCNExrEF399fE7JqT0pmqj1MpEhj-VA">Science of Us</a></p>

<h3 dir="ltr">Black Teens Are Breaking the Internet and Seeing None of the Profit</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Many of the most popular posts on social media platforms like Vine and Youtube come from the black community. Popular phrases, dances and trends originate from these posts, yet it’s hard to track ownership as ideas and content become a part of mass culture. For example, did you know “on fleek” started from one teen’s Vine account?  Ownership of content and ideas has now become a source for debate around cultural appropriation. “Part of the reason the originators of viral content are stripped from their labor is because they don’t technically own their production. Twitter does, Vine does, Snapchat does, and the list goes on,” Doreen St. Felix argues in this piece on <a href="http://www.thefader.com/2015/12/03/on-fleek-peaches-monroee-meechie-viral-vines" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://www.thefader.com/2015/12/03/on-fleek-peaches-monroee-meechie-viral-vines&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1465326769528000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHSFHqdCU0aKrzdkxFQ4r4Accphhw">Fader</a>.</p>

<h3 dir="ltr">‘Like’ It or Not, Teen Brain is Primed to Join the Crowd</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Teen brains are trained to like what’s “cool” or “socially appropriate” based on what other people have liked on social media, according to researchers. The popularity of a photo and the number of ‘likes’ it has can impact the way it is perceived. The higher the number of likes, the more likely someone will also “like” it. Popular photos that receive a lot of “likes” activate regions in the brain associated with extreme pleasure, vision, social memories, rewards and imitation.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/02/like-it-or-not-teen-brain-is-primed-to-join-the-crowd/" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/06/02/like-it-or-not-teen-brain-is-primed-to-join-the-crowd/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1465326769528000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFArujPl3uGxzKKO29rM2k5VolGg">The Washington Post</a></p>

<h2 dir="ltr"></h2>
<h2 dir="ltr">Using Movies to Move People to Action</h2>

<hr />

<h3 dir="ltr"> The Director of HBO's "All the Way" Talks LBJ, MLK, and What They Can Teach Today's Pols</h3>
<p dir="ltr">This new HBO film tells the story of President Lyndon B. Johnson and the events and emotions surrounding his presidency.  Even though the movie depicts the past, there are lessons to be learned for modern-day politics. Director Jay Roach hopes that the film can set an example of great political leadership aimed at improving citizen’s lives.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[We are horrified and heartbroken over the tragedy in Orlando. In the early morning hours, a gunman opened fire at a gay nightclub, leaving 50 individuals dead and more than 50 injured. Our hearts are with our fellow Floridians and the LGBTQ community, their families and friends reeling from this senseless act of terror and the tragic loss of innocent lives.

As flags fly at half-staff today, let us recognize that they still wave proudly and stand for peace, understanding and acceptance. The response from our brothers and sisters across Florida and the country has been remarkable. Residents have appeared in thousands to donate their time and blood to those in need, not only in Orlando but throughout the state. Our fellow regional associations and funders stand ready to offer assistance and support.

For some of us, it can feel overwhelming on where and how to lend a hand. Monetary donations are fast, flexible and effective ways to make a direct impact during Orlando’s time of need. You and your organization can be part of an effort to provide immediate and long-term assistance to the victims of tragedy, as well the broader community. As Florida nonprofits and philanthropic organizations address the short-term and long-term needs of the community, you can join them in the following ways:

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and <strong><a href="http://cityoforlando.net/">City of Orlando</a></strong> announced the formation of the <strong>OneOrlando Fund</strong>. The distribution of the funds will be administered by the <a href="http://cffound.org/"><strong>Central Florida Foundation</strong></a>. The purpose of the Fund is to provide a way to help respond to the needs of our community, now and in the time to come, after the effects of the Pulse nightclub tragedy. Central Florida Foundation serves as the region’s community foundation and is home to more than 400 charitable funds. <strong><a href="https://cffound.org/news/story/orlando_mayor_buddy_dyer_announces_oneorlando_fund#sthash.8h5LQr23.aAO8ngIr.dpbs">Learn more.</a></strong>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the Arts Responded to the Orlando Shooting</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Watch Lin-Manuel Miranda and James Corden Pay Tribute To Orlando At The Tony Awards</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">Broadway stars honored the victims of the Orlando shooting at the Tony awards. While accepting the award for best score for the Broadway play Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda recited a sonnet he wrote about the Orlando tragedy. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">"Love is love is love is love is love is love is love is love; Cannot be killed or swept aside."</span>

&nbsp;
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over 60 of Your Favorite Broadway Stars Recorded a Song for Orlando and It Is Breathtaking</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">60 Broadway stars came together to pay tribute to the Orlando victims by singing a rendition of “What The World Needs Now Is Love.” The ensemble included Broadway legends like </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bernadette Peters and Audra McDonald, along with Lin-Manuel Miranda, Sara Bareilles, Sean Hayes, Matthew Broderick and Carole King. All of the proceeds from the song will go to the LGBT Community Center of Central Florida. </span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What You Can Do</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">4 Ways to Protest the Blood Ban on Queer Men and Still Fill a Dire Need</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the aftermath of the Orlando shooting, the public was urged to donate blood to the surviving victims. People lined the streets to donate. However, people on social media pointed out that the queer friends and partners of the victims couldn’t help due to a ban on gay men donating blood. Despite this ban, there are other ways to help, like asking people to donate on your behalf, volunteering at a blood drive, and supporting organizations working to lift the blood ban.</span>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dancing is a Safe Haven for the LGBT Community</span></h2>

<hr />

<h2></h2>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Only When I’m Dancing Can I Feel This Free</span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: 400;">LGBT Advocates have pointed out the importance of dance clubs like Pulse for their community. Dancing creates a feeling of security and fellowship for queer men and women. It allows them to lose themselves in the music, feel good and connect with their community.</span>

		<title>What You See May Affect What You Eat</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016/06/what-you-see-may-affect-what-you-eat/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">You spend hours picking the best words and crafting the perfect message to move your audience to action.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, only thinking about words is short-sighted. Why limit yourself to just words, when you can use surroundings and visuals too? That’s like coloring a picture with just one color, and wouldn’t that be the most boring picture ever? Research suggests that you can also creatively and strategically use psychology, visuals and people’s everyday surroundings to achieve your goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is particularly true when it comes to getting people to eat and drink less to curb obesity. From children to teens to adults, visual cues within their everyday lives can be effective for changing unhealthy behavior.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in one study Public Health Scholar and White House Fellow <a href="https://vimeo.com/121145324">Sara Bleich</a>, and her colleagues, wanted to know if sharing easily understandable signs that explained simply the exercise required to burn off calories from soda in corner stores, frequented by black adolescent teens, could lower their purchasing behavior. They focused on black teens because</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, on average, they drink larger amounts of sugary beverages, and are at higher risk for obesity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">They put up various types of “Did you know?” signs around Baltimore City. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">These brightly colored 8.5-by-11-inch signs, placed in prominent locations on each beverage case in each corner store, asked:</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that a bottle of soda or fruit juice has about 250 calories?</span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that a bottle of soda or fruit juice has about 16 teaspoons of sugar?</span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that working off a bottle of soda or fruit juice takes about 50 minutes of running?</span></i>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did you know that working off a bottle of soda or fruit juice takes about 5 miles of walking? </span></i>

They collected data on over 4,500 purchases and found that for up to 6 weeks after the signs were removed from the store, teens purchased less sugar-sweetened beverages than before the study had began.

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The most effective signs equated calories with the number of miles required to walk off the calories in a bottle. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This research suggests that you can speak to the inner couch potato in your audience and show them how much more exercise they would have to do just for one bottle of soda.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to changing how people think about the calories in food, other studies suggest that understandable signs can be used to train children how to make healthy food choices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in one </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/happiness-is-finding-food-labels-that-lead-to-better-choices/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">psychologists Gregory Privitera and his colleagues found that when food is labeled with emoticons — a happy face to depict healthy food and a sad face for less healthy food — children are more likely to make healthier food choices. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In their study, 75 children, pre-k to 5th grade, were given a pretest to assess how much they related emoticons with food. In the pretest, children were shown either a picture of healthy food with a happy face emoticon or a picture of unhealthy food with a sad face emoticon. The kids were asked to circle the healthy food to assess if they associated emoticons with healthy and unhealthy food. In this first test no grade level scored 100%. Bummer.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The children were then given a two-hour health lesson that taught the kids that the happy face emoticon is linked to food that is “good for your body” and the sad face emoticon is linked to food that is “not as good for your body.” After the lesson, the kids took the test again and they all scored 100%. Hooray!</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Following this little experiment, the children were faced with the real life dilemma of selecting new snacks to include in the school cafeteria.  The children had to select from a dozen round food containers, but could not see what is inside. However, all the containers were labeled with emoticons. Importantly, the labels on the containers mimicked labeling that could be found on standard food packaging including information on taste, branding and popularity.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers found that “a significant proportion of children used the emoticons to make food choices and that their choices were specifically for healthy foods.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, they also found that “competing information” did not impact the effectiveness of using emoticons.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The study suggests that using emoticons, or what the researchers call “emolabeling” (throw that down in your next strategy meeting), can be useful for getting kids to make healthier food choices.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other factors influencing what and how much people eat are their habits and routines. Unfortunately, getting people to make healthier choices, especially when unhealthy choices are habitual, is a daunting task. People do not like to be told what they are doing is wrong or bad, and they certainly are going to plug their ears if you tell them to stop eating their favorite unhealthy snacks. So sometimes the easier thing to do is just change their options. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One </span><a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2005/11/big-portions-influence-overeating-much-taste-even-when-food-tastes-lousy-cornell"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, conducted by food marketing and psychology scholar Brian Wansink, and his colleagues, involved 177 moviegoers and a lot of popcorn. They were interested in understanding irrational eating behavior and overeating. In this experiment, unsuspecting movie goers were each given a soft drink and a free bag of popcorn.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the moviegoers were given a free soft drink and popcorn, but the specifics of this free snack varied. Some moviegoers received fresh popcorn and others were given stale, gross, 14-day-old popcorn. The size of the bag varied, too, with some participants receiving their popcorn in a medium size bag and others in a large bag. Both bags were large enough that no single movie-goer would be able to finish it. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The researchers wanted to know if people with bigger bags would eat more popcorn than those who received smaller bags and whether the freshness of the popcorn had an impact. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The difference in what the moviegoers ate was insane. Moviegoers who were given fresh popcorn ate 45.3% more popcorn when it was given to them in large containers. The bag size was so powerful that even when the popcorn was stale, people given the large bags still ate 33.6% more popcorn than those who got smaller bags.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, in a survey taken after the film, the moviegoers who were given the bigger bags and ate more popcorn described the popcorn as “stale,” “soggy,” or “terrible.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">This suggests that these people weren't eating for pleasure or because they were hungry. They were mindlessly eating bad popcorn that they didn't like just because their bag was bigger.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What does this study mean for communications? If, let’s say, you want to address obesity, or curb overeating, asking people to eat less may not be the best strategy. Rather, in this case, sometimes, you just need to give people a smaller bag of popcorn, or change their situation.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What else can communicators do to help people make healthier choices?  Research suggests that playing with the audience's eye can also work. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In one </span><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2689199"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, marketing scholar Brennan Davis and his colleagues tested whether changing  participants’ perception of the size of food can have an impact how many calories they consume.  They designed  an experiment involving 219 college students, 4 pizza pies (free!) and 4 differently sized round tables. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Participants either saw a pizza pie cut into 16 smaller slices or 8 larger pieces. The pizzas were presented either on a smaller table or a large table to play with perception of the size of the pizza. They found that participants tended to eat more of the smaller slices, but consumed fewer calories because they thought they were eating more.  Even when they tried to make the smaller slices seem bigger by putting them on a relatively bigger table, the students ate fewer calories.
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This happened because—compared to people choosing from small tables— attentional scope shifted away from the smallness of the pizza slices and towards the largeness of the table on which it was placed resulting in people perceiving the smaller pizza slices as closer to regular in size,” the researchers explain.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Collectively all this science suggests that we should use visual cues in our audience’s everyday lives to help them change their unhealthy behavior. Sometimes people just don’t want to change, but making changes for them – whether that’s the table the food is presented on, the size of the bag the treats come in or the labeling on their favorite snack– can be effective for building a healthier society.</span>]]></content:encoded>

<p class="graf--p graf-after--p">While these campaigns might garner attention, you’ve got to wonder: How effective are they at driving behavior change?</p>
<p id="7e43" class="graf--p graf-after--p">That was a question Dr. Julia Fraustino and her colleague Liang Ma sought to answer in their study: <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00909882.2015.1019544" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00909882.2015.1019544">CDC’s Use of Social Media and Humor in a Risk Campaign — “Preparedness 101: Zombie Apocalypse.”</a></p>
<p id="9a35" class="graf--p graf-after--p">At the recent <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016-prize/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2016-prize/"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">frank</em>2016</a> conference, Fraustino spoke about her study and what it means for social change communicators.</p>
<p id="5613" class="graf--p graf-after--p">In the study, they found that while the CDC’s campaign went viral, with more than 3.6 billion impressions from traditional and social media coverage in a matter of a few months, the campaign’s reference to zombies made people significantly less likely to be prepared, make a disaster kit and have a plan.</p>
<p id="00a5" class="graf--p graf-after--p">In other words, the CDC’s campaign <span class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">backfired</span>.</p>

<blockquote id="fdcd" class="graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><span class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong"><span class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">Their communications goal (having as many people as possible see their message) succeeded, but it actually worked against their program goal (having people make disaster kits and have disaster plans).</span></span></blockquote>
<p id="ea42" class="graf--p graf-after--blockquote">It is important to know that while humor can be used as an effective tool to reach audiences and generate awareness, in a health context, humor may trivialize the issue.</p>
<p id="f3dc" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">And in Fraustino’s words, “If you don’t think something’s serious, you’re not going to prepare for it.”</p>

		<title>Sometimes you have to confront the fact that you may not be the rockstar you want to be. We did. And here’s what happened.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Two years ago, our small web team set out to build a site as badass and smart as the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">community itself, one that could drive and inform the field with great insights from social science research, useful examples from throughout the interwebs, and thoughtful commentary from the smartest people we know. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It took everything we had to scotch tape our little website together. Two years ago, </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology-main/">ology</a> was born, and since then we’ve shared more than 150 summaries of peer-reviewed research. On the <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/speak-frankly/"><em>frank</em> blog</a>, leaders from our field shared the best of what they know. We scoured the internet for relevant news and stories and posted hundreds of them. Great designers made the site beautiful and easy to navigate.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We leaned back with pride and waited to see how it would be put to work by the practitioners we live to serve. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Thousands of hours and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/frankgathering/?fref=ts">F</a><a href="https://www.facebook.com/frankgathering/?fref=ts">acebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/frankgathering">Twitter</a> posts later, we took a hard look at the results and weren’t really happy with what we saw.  Almost no one was seeing the content. Most of our frankologies were read by Lauren Griffin’s mom--and no one else (Thank you, Ramona. We love you.) </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, our team spent the last six months talking to some of the smartest people in the business about how to transform </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital into something different. Something special. Something that would help you do your work better and win more every day. </span>

And we finally did the one thing every good communicator must do before they set off to do a big project: research!  Why didn’t we think of that before?!

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We’ve spent the last few months understanding you better, learning how you think about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, what you want </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital to be and what sort of content and resources you just can’t live without. We did surveys, focus groups and got super-obsessed with our web and social analytics. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After we checked, it turned out that yes, in fact we were doing everything wrong. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">You told us that you want a way to connect with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> community year round, and more ways to mine the wisdom of this community. Turns out we were spending way too much time sharing our perspectives and amplifying our voice when what you really wanted was to hear and connect with each other. We also found out that while you wanted to know about useful research, you wanted to read about it in action (or at least get some direction about how to use it). </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We also heard that the thing you love most about the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">gathering is getting the chance to let your hair down and stop being the smartest person in the room. You love learning from other visionaries who are transforming our field through using great strategy and messaging. And so many of you are really generous about sharing your own successes--and missteps. So there are plenty of good stories waiting to be told. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We want to help you do your work better and be the resource you wish existed. So now the frank team is in the process of relaunching </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital. Here are some changes you’ll see over the next few months: </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are transforming our social media into a space for you all to connect and learn from each other and using it as a tool to find great work, rather than promote our own message. You will see Facebook Live events featuring your fellow </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sters. You will see #</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lycurious twitter chats where you can share your questions with your community, share your success (and failure) stories and tell us what you’re up to. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Our little team also realized after two years of plugging away at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ology that we could reach more people if we published in places you and future </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">sters already are.  So we’ve decided to put frankology on sabbatical and play with alternative ways of sharing ideas and relevant science. </span>

A few weeks ago, <a href="https://theconversation.com/most-americans-believe-we-should-have-gun-regulation-here-is-why-those-who-dont-are-winning-the-debate-61251">we wrote a piece </a>summarizing some great scholarship on worldviews and gun control. Within 24 hours of being published on The Conversation, the story had more than 100,000 reads, and was ranked as the most shared story from the University of Florida, ever, (you may have seen us in Quartz, HuffPost, Business Insider and Guns– although that last one can stay our little secret).  It had more eyeballs on it than all our web content and social media posts--ever, combined.  So, we found a bright spot, and we’re learning from it.

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> digital is about you. To make it work we’ll be directing our resources toward your ideas, experiences and questions. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, why would we share this? Because maybe you’re making some of these mistakes too, and wondering why people aren’t devouring the amazing content on your site. (We checked, your content is amazing). Maybe you’ve been frustrated that we haven’t been giving you what you wanted. Most likely, you didn’t know we were here, because we weren’t being thoughtful enough about where you are and how to get this to you in a way that would help you be more amazing. We’ll keep sharing what we’re learning along the way, and in the end, we’ll all be </span><a href="http://nonprofitwithballs.com/2016/01/welcome-back-to-work-you-sexy-jedi-unicorn/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sexy ninja unicorn rockstars. </span></a>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[This is, frankly, awesome (and yes, pun somewhat intended). As communicators, we often get caught up in believing that our efforts have value only if we hit the mark on all our outcomes. Every. Single. Time. The whole point of the evaluation in Research Planning Implementation and Evaluation is not just to prove we were rock stars all along, but to use the information -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- to adjust our approach in order to accomplish what we intended to accomplish in the first place. Kudos for practicing what we preach!]]></wp:comment_content>

<p id="be9c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Given that 2016 is <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/99-percent-chance-2016-hottest-year-20359" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/99-percent-chance-2016-hottest-year-20359">expected to be the hottest year on record</a>, with several months that not only surpassed old heat records but did so by <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201603" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/global/201603">increasingly large margins</a>, it stands to reason climate change should be an issue we as a nation are rushing to address. But we’re not, exactly. Instead, climate scientists are subject to <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/07/climate-scientists-are-under-attack-from-frivolous-lawsuits" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/jul/07/climate-scientists-are-under-attack-from-frivolous-lawsuits">political attacks and lawsuits</a>, and debate over whether climate change even exists <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jul/12/us-senators-detail-a-climate-science-web-of-denial-but-the-impacts-go-well-beyond-their-borders" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/planet-oz/2016/jul/12/us-senators-detail-a-climate-science-web-of-denial-but-the-impacts-go-well-beyond-their-borders">roils the United States Senate</a>. A reasonable person could be left wondering how the hell we got here.</p>
<p id="91e4" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Social scientists have made great strides in determining <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/not-so-cool-conservative-white-men-are-more-likely-to-deny-climate-change/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/not-so-cool-conservative-white-men-are-more-likely-to-deny-climate-change/">what factors influence climate denier attitudes</a> and what kinds of messages have the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/14532/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/14532/">potential to combat denial</a>. Indeed, a burgeoning movement of academics and communicators are taking on the problem of climate denial with gusto, working nonstop to produce empirically based strategies for getting the message out to the public.</p>
<p id="5c7b" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Despite these efforts, researchers have paid less attention to how we’re talking about climate change in a larger cultural sense.</p>
<p id="054c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Enter “Sharknado.” On July 31, the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.syfy.com/sharknado4" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.syfy.com/sharknado4">fourth installment of the “Sharknado” film series</a> airs on SyFy. The low-budget films are a surprise smash hit, breaking records in 2013 with the original <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2724064/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2724064/">“Sharknado.”</a> It’s led to a series of movies and a variety of media spin-offs, including a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/09/sharknado-the-video-game-announced" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/09/sharknado-the-video-game-announced">video game</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.sharknadobook.com/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.sharknadobook.com/">companion</a> book.</p>

<figure id="0524" class="graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p">
<div class="iframeContainer">[youtube id="Vc-JlFpXLn8"]</div>
</figure>
<p id="99e5" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">If you’ve missed this cultural phenomenon, worry not: The film’s title tells you most of what you need to know. Major American cities are suddenly beset with waterspouts flinging man-eating sharks — sharknados — through the air at 300 miles per hour, while characters attempt to survive. The plots are predictably ridiculous and the special effects — particularly in the first “Sharknado” — are about what you would expect from a B-movie.</p>
<p id="9cd5" class="graf--p graf-after--p">At their heart, however, the “Sharknado” films are stories about climate change, albeit in a way that is scientifically flawed to a comical degree. It’s a genre — climate disaster films — we decided to explore as an emerging mode of communication in society.</p>

<h3 id="4286" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Fiction helps us understand reality</h3>
<p id="b404" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">It’s explained in the original “Sharknado” that climate change has created an unusually strong tropical cyclone approaching Southern California. The sequels backed away from that explanation, whether out of a desire to avoid courting political controversy or simply because the creators felt that sharknados needed no explanation, we can’t be sure. But casting climate change as a catalyst for extreme, globally threatening natural disasters is a move characteristic of a small but growing genre of climate disaster films.</p>
<p id="68ba" class="graf--p graf-after--p">With a few notable exceptions (“<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/">The Day After Tomorrow</a>” and “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Snowpiercer</a>” come to mind), climate disaster films tend to be low-budget, made-for-television creatures. Silly as they may seem, they represent <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/climate-fiction-margaret-atwood-literature/400112/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/climate-fiction-margaret-atwood-literature/400112/">the first drops</a> in what is sure to be a storm of <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/telling-the-story-of-climate-change-in-fiction/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/telling-the-story-of-climate-change-in-fiction/">fictional depictions of climate change</a>as the issue gains more traction in the public consciousness. In a very real sense, these films are the product of a society attempting to grapple with a massive social threat unlike anything we’ve seen before.</p>
<p id="1adc" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/climate-fiction-margaret-atwood-literature/400112/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/08/climate-fiction-margaret-atwood-literature/400112/">Climate fiction films</a> are important for their potential impact on the public. Climate change itself is difficult to observe for those not trained in environmental sciences; typically people don’t notice small changes that happen over time, and carbon dioxide emissions are invisible to the naked eye. Meteorological and climatological records are <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/03/11/climate_change_denial_anti_reality_mongers_are_in_trouble.html" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2015/03/11/climate_change_denial_anti_reality_mongers_are_in_trouble.html">regularly questioned by climate deniers</a>, some of whom <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/30/global_warming_inhofe_still_denying_reality.html" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/30/global_warming_inhofe_still_denying_reality.html">hold political office</a>. Even personal experience may not sway opinions: Research suggests that <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/no-small-talk-how-discussions-about-weather-reveal-our-political-affiliations/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/no-small-talk-how-discussions-about-weather-reveal-our-political-affiliations/">a person’s political leanings can even affect whether he or she perceives unusual weather patterns to be out of the ordinary</a>.</p>
<p id="7217" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Some scholars hypothesize that this is where <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://theliterarylink.com/leguinintro.html" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://theliterarylink.com/leguinintro.html">fiction comes in</a>. As researcher David Kirby puts it, fiction can serve as a <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://sss.sagepub.com/content/33/2/231.abstract" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://sss.sagepub.com/content/33/2/231.abstract">“virtual witnessing tool”</a> that lets us see the scientific process. Literary scholars tout science fiction’s ability to show us futures that have not yet come to pass without having to live through them. Indeed, one of fiction’s power is this ability to let us <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.good.is/articles/climate-fiction-cli-fi-genre" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.good.is/articles/climate-fiction-cli-fi-genre">explore scenarios and situations in a safe way</a>, without real risk to life or property.</p>
<p id="a33c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Consider, for instance, the prevalence of fiction about nuclear war during the Cold War. These stories were widely credited with helping society envision the future after a nuclear exchange even as political leaders worked to prevent such an event. Books (and later film adaptations) like “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-Safe_%28novel" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fail-Safe_%28novel">Fail-Safe</a>” and “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_%28novel" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_%28novel">On the Beach</a>” shaped society’s understanding of the consequences of nuclear war. Television shows like the “Twilight Zone” featured stories — and warnings — about nuclear weapons prominently in their plots. President Ronald Reagan <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2307407461.html" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2307407461.html">even noted in his journal</a> the television movie “<a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0319262/">The Day After Tomorrow</a>” had a profound effect on him.</p>

<h3 id="9f96" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Medium for misinformation?</h3>
<p id="cb53" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">What does this mean for climate change? Like nuclear war, a future in which humanity has undertaken no effort to combat climate change is one we hope to never see. Can fiction play a role in shaping our attitudes and beliefs about climate change and encourage the public to take the threat seriously before it’s too late?</p>
<p id="7a28" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="https://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/_docs/200411_environment1.pdf" rel="nofollow" data-href="https://www.upf.edu/pcstacademy/_docs/200411_environment1.pdf">handful</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.climateprediction.net/wp-content/schools/tyndall_DAT.pdf" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.climateprediction.net/wp-content/schools/tyndall_DAT.pdf">of studies</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524030903265823?src=recsys" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17524030903265823?src=recsys">were conducted</a> around the release of “The Day After Tomorrow.” Similar studies were also conducted on <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378010000798" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378010000798">the docudrama “The Age of Stupid”</a> and <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/semi.2011.2011.issue-187/semi.2011.066/semi.2011.066.xml" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/semi.2011.2011.issue-187/semi.2011.066/semi.2011.066.xml">the documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.”</a> But these studies typically examine only blockbuster films and do not address disaster films as a whole.</p>
<p id="eab5" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The studies generally suggest that fictional depictions of climate change can have an effect on audiences — at least in the short term. Seeing clips of these films tends to raise levels of environmental concern and, in some cases, cause people to be more supportive of action to meet the climate threat.</p>

<figure id="ff7a" class="graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p">
<div class="iframeContainer">[youtube id="jBD9EkOLgiI"]</div>
</figure>
<p id="2c1a" class="graf--p graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--figure">‘The Day After Tomorrow’ depicts an out-of-control and damaging natural world.</p>
<p id="8537" class="graf--p graf-after--p">To get a better sense of how fictional disaster films shape environmental attitudes, I (Lauren) conducted an in-depth analysis of 18 disaster films featuring climate change. The results of my research show that most of these films make only tenuous connections between climate change and natural disasters, which affects how people react to them.</p>
<p id="f0aa" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Terminology related to climate change and extreme weather is often misused, and it’s not uncommon to see films that use the term “climate change” or “global warming” to refer to completely different phenomena — some of which are physically impossible and could happen in no world. For example, <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457701/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0457701/">one film</a> uses climate change to discuss a buildup of methane gas in the atmosphere that is predicted to ignite, incinerating all life on Earth.</p>
<p id="2020" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The results from focus groups I held with participants who watched one of three representative disaster films confirm that these scientifically dubious depictions of climate change dilute any perceived environmental message in climate disaster films. Most participants were unconvinced — often with good reason — that anything shown in the films could happen in the real world and did not see much of an environmental message.</p>
<p id="d026" class="graf--p graf-after--p">More worrisome is the possibility for climate fiction films to distribute misinformation. Because many films draw on real terminology used by climatologists and atmospheric scientists to add a sense of realism to their films, audiences may find themselves confused where fiction ends and facts begin.</p>

<h3 id="841d" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Here to stay</h3>
<p id="506e" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">There is some precedence for these concerns. <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF%27s/Butler%20et%20al%20%282009%29_PsychSci.pdf" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF%27s/Butler%20et%20al%20%282009%29_PsychSci.pdf">Research on historical fiction films</a> <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-012-9204-0" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10648-012-9204-0">suggests</a> that people often remember misinformation presented in fictional narratives and then attribute these “facts” to authoritative sources like textbooks. This has been observed even when participants are warned ahead of time that they will be seeing a dramatization of a historical event that contains inaccuracies.</p>
<p id="3533" class="graf--p graf-after--p">As society struggles to envision a future shaped by climate change, we will continue to produce works of fiction that depict these futures. Climate disaster films are only one facet of this phenomenon, and more are sure to come.</p>
<p id="ab6b" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Follow-up studies examining the <a class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" href="http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2014/11/the-long-melt-the-lingering-influence-of-the-day-after-tomorrow/" rel="nofollow" data-href="http://www.yaleclimateconnections.org/2014/11/the-long-melt-the-lingering-influence-of-the-day-after-tomorrow/">effects of “The Day After Tomorrow”</a> on public attitudes toward climate change hint at possible changes.</p>
<p id="f155" class="graf--p graf-after--p">In the short term, audiences were more concerned about climate change after viewing the film and were more willing to take some political action to combat the threat. Long term, the film seemed to clue audiences in to the problems of climate change, and provided something of a cultural script with which to discuss it.</p>
<p id="a91f" class="graf--p graf-after--p">It’s worth noting, however, that “The Day After Tomorrow” was an exception within the larger climate disaster film genre, both in terms of its production value and its (relatively) detailed discussion of climate change. Low-budget films like “Sharknado,” which stray very far afield from climate science, likely pose different possibilities for both misinformation and engagement with climate change. The question, then, is how to best tap into this potential while avoiding the pitfalls.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Brandon Telg and Jaron Jones</em>

Over the next week, <a href="http://www.selfnarrate.com">Self Narrate</a>, a Gainesville-based nonprofit run by two <em>frank</em>sters, will be taking over <i>frank</i>’s social media presence. To kick off the week, we wanted to introduce ourselves and what we do to the <i>frank </i>community.

Self Narrate is a nonprofit organization dedicated to personal story development. The co-founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/btelg">Brandon Telg </a>and <a href="https://twitter.com/Grown_5imba">Dr. Jaron Jones</a>, empower their community by helping people craft and share their personal stories. Storytelling is a powerful tool for developing self-efficacy, building relationships and gaining perspective.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tedxuf1.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-14693 alignnone" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/tedxuf1.jpg" alt="tedxuf1" width="2048" height="1365" /></a>

Self Narrate started with a simple challenge: “Tell me your story.”

Brandon and Jaron met in their first graduate class at the University of Florida, which was on interpersonal leadership. They were both pursuing degrees in the leadership development program; Jaron had just started his Ph.D., and Brandon was working on his master’s. The premise of this interpersonal leadership course was how it is necessary to know about yourself before you can lead anyone else.

The main activity for the class was presenting a 20-minute personal story about a moment in each student’s life. This story needed to be about a paradigm shifting moment of dynamic change.

Brandon and Jaron quickly realized that the last time anyone asked them to tell a story about something important to them was likely show-and-tell in kindergarten. They both had a challenging time figuring out what story they would each share, but after they completed the activity, they had a realization. Developing their stories, sharing them with an audience and receiving positive feedback from their peers was motivating. They felt great about themselves. They realized that they had overcome some tough life situations and that they can overcome anything that lies ahead in the future.

This experience was so revelatory for them, they knew that they couldn’t let this stay in that classroom. Their final assignment for the class was a group project. They had to go out into the community and create change. They knew what they had to do.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/our_sign.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-14694 alignnone" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/our_sign.jpg" alt="our_sign" width="1000" height="665" /></a>

They decided that they would set up at different locations around the University of Florida campus with a sign that read, “Tell us a story, and we’ll give you a dollar.” What could be more motivating to broke college students than “free” money? They were so excited to share this storytelling experience with other students. More than 5,000 students walked past them each day. Can you guess how many students stopped to share their stories? Three. Just three students approached their handwritten sign that first day. Each day after was a similar experience. Neither Brandon nor Jaron could understand this phenomenon. It didn’t make sense. They couldn’t pay people to share their stories? When the dollar menu is a main food group for many college students, they couldn’t understand what was happening. So they decided to ask.

The students who did share their stories relayed two important facts. First, they thought there was a catch to the activity. And to be fair, the sign did look a bit suspicious. After all, Brandon’s handwriting is… objectively not great. Second, they said that they didn’t feel they had a story that was important enough to share. Both Jaron and Brandon were so disheartened because they believe that every person’s story matters.

From that moment on, they knew that they had to bring storytelling to their community and to the world. They saw a need to create a way for anyone to develop and share their story. So they did.

<a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/frank2.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-14695 alignnone" src="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/frank2.png" alt="frank2" width="1662" height="1002" /></a>

Jaron and Brandon developed a method to help people write their stories for the first time. They led workshops throughout the community for schools, nonprofits and other community-focused organizations. Over time, they facilitated numerous story development workshops, have had story development papers published, hosted large-scale story-focused events and even co-authored a book on how to write your story.

Ultimately, Jaron and Brandon want every person that comes in contact with the work of Self Narrate to understand two simple truths:

<b>You Have a Story </b>and <b>Your Story Matters.</b>

We all carry an innate desire to discover the meaning of our lives, to connect the dots, to interact with the world, and determine what our experiences mean to us. This quest for self-understanding is part of what makes us human. Humans have been telling stories for as long as we’ve existed, in order to understand and share the meaning of our experiences.

You are the only person who has lived through your unique experiences in life, who has encountered the same relationships and lessons and hardships at the same moments. No one else ever has or will interact with the world in the exact same way as you. The context of your life generates a wonderfully remarkable setting for your story, and your story alone.

Never stop identifying the key moments in your life. Always continue to find the truths in your story – about you, your life, and your experiences. Each moment of your life has tremendous meaning. Sometimes we just have to look at the big picture in order to discover our stories.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Brandon Telg and Jaron Jones</em>

One of the biggest hurdles to overcome when writing one’s story is knowing where to start. For this reason, it is helpful to start with parameters. So we challenge you to write your story within this parameter: one sentence. What is your story in one sentence? Take some time and think about this.

You may be saying to yourself “one sentence? I’ve had way too many life experiences for one sentence.” Certainly you can’t share every detail about your life in one sentence, but limiting yourself to one sentence helps you identify the <i>essence</i>. This if your story at its most raw. This is who you are.

So write your story in a sentence. We want to know what your story is! Leave a comment below or <a href="https://twitter.com/SelfNarrate">tweet it at us</a>.

<em>Brandon and Jaron literally wrote the book on using self narratives to drive self discovery, community and social change. They gave the frank community a free <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/booksample.pdf">chapter</a>. Hooray!</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>If You&#039;re Going to Change the World, You Better Bring Your Stories: An Interview with Andy Goodman</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>This Wednesday, storytelling coach and guru Andy Goodman will be live on Twitter to answer questions for the frank community. We talked with Andy about his career journey, the craft of storytelling and how organizations can use stories to communicate who they are better. We hope you enjoy this conversation as much as we did. </em>

&nbsp;

<strong>Storytelling is obviously a passion of yours, where did it all begin?</strong>

Well, it’s funny, my dream growing up was to write for television. I wanted to write sitcoms. I thought that would be the most fun. I moved out to Los Angeles in 1991 with the dream of becoming a network sitcom writer and I was fortunate, I got to work on a couple of network TV shows on ABC and CBS. One called<em> Dinosaurs</em> on ABC, which was a Jim Henson and Walt Disney co-production and another show called <em>The Nanny</em> on CBS. Working on those shows, I learned an awful lot about storytelling. You know when I went to apply to work on those shows I told the producers of the shows, “Hey, I’m a funny guy I come up with funny jokes” and they said “There’s lots of funny people in Hollywood. Our show is 22 stories every year. Can you come up with stories?” And that was my graduate school in storytelling. That’s where I learned how to tell a story very efficiently, in a very confined time period and strict format that would keep people glued to their seats watching.

<strong>What drove you into professional storytelling?</strong>

After I got out of the TV business, I went to run a nonprofit in Los Angeles for 5 years called the Environmental Media Association (EMA). Once I got into the nonprofit community, I started to meet lots of nice people in nonprofits, foundations, government agencies, etc. You know, people who are working to make the world better. What I noticed about these people was that they were terrific people, passionate about what they did, but not so terrific about talking about it. Specifically when it came to telling stories. So after 5 years in the nonprofit world, running a nonprofit, meeting colleagues and seeing this big communication deficit, I started my own firm in 1998, <a href="http://www.thegoodmancenter.com">The Goodman Center</a>, specifically to help nonprofits communicate better. Overtime my specialty became storytelling because that’s where I saw the greatest need.
<blockquote>"If you’re in the business of changing the world for the better, then you are often first in the business of changing the story in people’s heads about the way the world works," says Goodman.</blockquote>
<strong>Why is storytelling so important for the field of public interest communications?</strong>

When you look at the research at how our minds work, the average human being, what you’ll find is that each of us walks around with a bunch of stories in our head about the way the world works. And whatever we confront, whatever facts are presented to us, whatever data we run into, we filter through these stories. And if the data agrees with our stories, we’ll let it in and if it doesn’t, we’ll reject it. So, if you’re trying to give people new information that they don’t have, they’ve got to have a story in their head that will let that data in, so you can persuade them to change what they think, what they believe, how they behave. So, what I like to say to the groups I work with is, “If you’re in the business of changing the world for the better, then you are often first in the business of changing the story in people’s heads about the way the world works.” So, in the social change world, storytelling is an absolutely essential tool.

<strong>What would you say makes some stories better than others?</strong>

I can’t give you a short answer to that because over time we’ve seen around the world – different races, different nationalities, different ethnicities – people all tend to tell stories the same way and the most commonly used structure is the 3-act structure. Stories have a beginning, middle and end where you meet the characters in the beginning, they go on a journey in the middle, and in the end there’s some type of destination, some type of objective achieved or not. There’s more to it than that, but that basic arc, that basic 3-act structure, a lot of good things happened when you use that structure, in terms of your audience’s response. If you do it right they will identify with the character of the story, they will see in them something in themselves. If you do it right they will care about what happened to them and be emotionally involved in the story. At the end, having seen what happens and what journey the characters go on, they will reflect on that and say, “What does that mean for me? Would I have made the same choices? Would I want the same thing?” And they’ll be prepared to act on that. They’ll either be inspired to act, or not act, but because they felt something, they’ll be ready to do something. And so the beauty of a good story is that it can generate an emotional response for your audience that prepares them to act. And you know as well as I do, it’s sort of common sense, if you don’t feel, if you don’t care, you don’t do. So the beauty of stories is they get the blood pumping, they get the heart pumping, they get us to start caring, and then we’re just one step away from doing.
<blockquote>"What makes stories interesting is the conflict, the tension between wanting to do something and being able to do it," says Goodman.</blockquote>
<strong>When is a story not a story?</strong>

There are a lot of websites in the nonprofit world that will have a link saying “Read our Story” and you’ll click on that link and you’ll get to these pieces which are not stories, they might just be a testimonial, they might be description of what they do, but there are no characters to identify with, there is no journey to go on, there’s no tension or conflict. One of the things that’s axiomatic about storytelling, particularly out here in Hollywood, is they say “no conflict, no story.” If your story is simply, “people are in trouble, we’ve launched this project to help them, they’re better now” it’s not an interesting story. What makes stories interesting is the conflict, the tension between wanting to do something and being able to do it. The way I put it is, in storytelling, until “I want” runs into “you can’t” you don’t have a story. Too many nonprofits tell stories of “I want, I did, now give me money” and that’s not interesting or memorable.

<strong>What would be your advice for someone who wanted to delve in the art and science of storytelling?</strong>

If you want to be a good storyteller, it’s like anything else, you have to put in the time and study the craft. You don’t come out to Hollywood and just write a screenplay because you want to and the same thing in the nonprofit world or public interest sector. You want to tell good stories, you have to learn the craft of storytelling, you have to learn structure of a good story, understand the qualities of a good story, all the ins and outs and it is a craft.

To me a craft is a certain amount of magic that you bring to it, your own talent, but also a certain amount of science, a certain amount of technique that you have to learn. Somewhere between all magic on one end of the continuum and all science on the other is what we call craft, or what you might call art, the combination of the magic in you and the technique you learn to bring it out. And so if you want to be a good storyteller you may have some natural magic in you, but you need to learn the craft to really bring out your talent.

<strong>Do you have any recommendations for books, videos, speakers, etc. that relate to storytelling?</strong>

There are tons of good books out there. For example, Paul Slovic, <a href="https://vimeo.com/156638027">who spoke at last year’s <em>frank</em> conference</a>, and his son Scott, they have a book called <em>Number and Nerves,</em> which is a collection of essays about how people take in information and about how we are numbed by numbers, but moved by stories. And so if you want to read a good overview of the area about why we should tell stories in the current literature, Scott and Paul Slovic’s <em>Numbers and Nerves</em> is a really good book to read to get you excited. If you want to practice the craft, there’s a book by Robert McKee called <em>Story </em>which is really a manual for screenwriters and TV writers, but even if that’s not your goal, there’s enough in there about the structure and quality of good storytelling to help anybody who wants to tell stories, so I highly recommend that book.

<strong>Have you ever missed a <em>frank</em> gathering?</strong>

I did, I missed the second one because my wife was running for city council in Los Angeles and election day was the Tuesday after the week of  <em>frank</em>. So I had to be in LA that week - that was a critical week to be in LA to work on her campaign. So if I had left home, I would have risked divorce at the time.

<strong>So how did you, if at all, integrate storytelling into her campaign?</strong>

I was always telling her, asking her, “What’s your personal narrative?” If people want to understand your personal story as a candidate, where you came from, who you are, or what you’re going to do, what’s the story they’re going to see, what’s the story you’re going to give them? So she spent a lot of time thinking about that so that when she got up and spoke in front of people, she would tell her story. Also I told her about the Marshall Ganz structure where leaders have to tell the story of self, the story of us and the story of now, and so she would follow that model as well.

<strong>Do you ever find that you have to adapt storytelling methods for various generations or do you find that they respond to different method over others?</strong>

Not so much. I get that question a lot, people say we live in the year of social media and shortening attention spans. I agree that its tougher to get people to stop and focus on a story, but the basic elements that make a story engaging and motivating, whether you’re watching a 2 minute video or reading 500 words off a screen or whatever, that hasn’t changed so much. I’m going to sound like Dr. Seuss here but the way I put it is “people are people wherever you go.” People love stories, they have for literally tens of thousands of years and sometimes I get the question, “Do you think we're burning out on stories, that if everyone is telling stories are they losing their effectiveness?” And I have to laugh because I don’t think suddenly in September of 2016 it’s like “welp, that’s it, were done.” The marketplace of ideas is more crowded, but if you can send a tweet that can get someone interested and has a link where they can go find the story and read it, they’ll read it like anybody, I don’t care how old they are.

<strong>Are there any project you are currently working on?</strong>

Yes, there are two I’m very excited about. For years I would work with groups doing workshops, like a half day workshop or a full day workshop, and hold out the hope that that would be transformational, that they would take the material and that the organization would be changed and would start to really change the way they communicate. In many cases it worked, but in a lot I felt like they just sort of checked off the box of  “ok, we did the storytelling workshop” and then basically reverted back to doing what they do. Now what I’m trying to do is contract with clients to have a relationship over a year where we start with a full day workshop, but then I’m coming back in 6 months, I’m coming back in 12 months to reinforce the lessons, to see what they’re doing and to really ensure that a storytelling culture is taking hold. So that’s a new direction for me that I’m excited about because it really ensures that anybody I spend time with, that they’re really going to get the full benefit of storytelling and not just have a half day workshop and then back to business as usual.

The other thing is I’m trying to develop a storytelling curriculum that will live on in other places without me. There’s a new university being born in Africa right now called the African Leadership University (ALU) and I developed a storytelling course for them that was taught for the first time this past spring to the first cohort of students to go through, but will become a permanent part of their curriculum. This is a university that ultimately is envisioning building 25 campuses across the continent of Africa with 10,000 students per campus. Now that’s a very ambitious project and that will be decades in rolling out, but if they get to their goal, my curriculum would be a part of this major university with 2 different campuses. And I’m also doing that now for the College of Social Innovation, which is something being launched in the Boston area. I’m developing some curriculum in storytelling for these college students, to teach them how to be better communicators by the time they arrive at a nonprofit. That’s the one work I’m really excited about.

<strong>Are there any campaigns or projects that have caught your attention?</strong>

Well there are a number of organizations out there that are doing great work where storytelling is concerned. Encore.org, which is a movement to create a new phase of life when it comes to work, where people who hit retirement age, instead of retiring, they decide to do something close to their heart and give back. People hitting age 60 or 65 are starting what they call an “encore” career, doing something good for the world. We have something like 10,000 baby boomers a day turning 65. That’s an awful lot of talent, awful lot of expertise, and do we want it all going to golf courses and museums or do we want maybe some of it going back to the social sector? And so Encore.org is trying to steer some of these people into the social sector to give back instead of kicking back and they are telling a lot of stories about people who are doing it successfully. It’s an organization I work with and I’m proud to see how they’re using storytelling to try and deal with this new phase of life.

		<title>Why Each Side of the Partisan Divide Thinks the Other is Living in an Alternate Reality</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[By Annie Neimand and Lauren Griffin

To some liberals, Donald Trump’s inauguration <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-reactions_us_5822f464e4b0d9ce6fc00710">portends doom for the republic</a>; to many conservatives, <a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/fl-trump-inauguration-florida-view-20170114-story.html">it’s a crowning moment for the nation</a> that will usher in an era of growth and optimism.

It’s as if each side is living in a different country – and a different reality.

In fact, over the last few months, a handful of liberal-leaning sites have begun fixating <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/trump-his-supporters-and-the-persistence-the-reality-gap">on what they’ve dubbed</a> the “reality gap”: the tendency of Donald Trump’s supporters to endorse misinformation about political and economic issues. <a href="http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2015/PPP_Release_National_120916.pdf">Sixty-seven percent</a> of Trump voters, for instance, believe that unemployment has gone up under President Obama’s administration. (<a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2016/01/obamas-numbers-january-2016-update/">It hasn’t</a>.) Up to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/18/a-new-poll-shows-an-astonishing-52-of-republicans-think-trump-won-the-popular-vote/">52 percent</a> believe that Trump won both the electoral college and the popular vote in the 2016 election. (<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/12/18/a-new-poll-shows-an-astonishing-52-of-republicans-think-trump-won-the-popular-vote/">He didn’t</a>.) And <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ljv2ohxmzj/econTabReport.pdf">74 percent</a> of Trump supporters believe that fewer people are insured now than before the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. (<a href="http://www.upi.com/Health_News/2016/12/21/Uninsured-rate-hits-new-low-due-to-Obamacare-Report/5161482351800/">More are</a>.)

But this unfairly casts conservatives as being blind to reality. In fact, people across the political spectrum are susceptible. Consider that <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ljv2ohxmzj/econTabReport.pdf">54 percent</a> of Democrats believe that Russia either “definitely” or “probably” changed voting tallies in the United States to get Trump elected. Although investigations are still ongoing, so far there’s been <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/01/what-did-the-senate-hearing-tell-us-about-russian-hacking/512309/">no evidence of direct tampering of voter records</a>.

Many are at a loss when trying to explain these findings and <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/12/14/505547295/fake-news-expert-on-how-false-stories-spread-and-why-people-believe-them">have blamed</a> a combination of “fake news,” politicians and slanted media.

Certainly misleading media reports and hyperpartisan social media users <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories">play a role in promoting misinformation</a>, and <a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/repeat-after-us-repetition-can-make-us-believe-misinformation/">politicians who repeat outright falsehoods</a> don’t help. But research suggests something else may be going on, and it’s no less insidious just because it can’t be blamed on our partisan enemies. It’s called information avoidance.
<h2>‘I don’t want to hear it’</h2>
Social scientists have documented that all of us have a well-stocked mental toolkit to ward off <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=2010-25386-006">any new information that makes us feel bad, obligates us to do something we don’t want to do or challenges our worldview</a>.

These mental gymnastics take place when we avoid looking at our bank account after paying the bills or shirk scheduling that long overdue doctor’s appointment. The same goes for our political affiliation and beliefs: If we’re confronted with news or information that challenges them, we’ll often ignore it.

One reason we avoid this sort of information is that it can make us feel bad, either about ourselves or more generally. For instance, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550613479803">one study found</a> that people didn’t want to see the results of a test for implicit racial bias when they were told that they might subconsciously have racist views. Because these results challenged how they saw themselves – as not racist – they simply avoided them.

<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009265661400021X">Another series of experiments</a> suggested that we’re more likely to avoid threatening information when we feel like we don’t have the close relationships and support system in place to respond to new problems. Patients who felt like they lacked a supportive network were less likely to want to see medical test results that might reveal a bad diagnosis. Students who lacked a large friend group or strong family ties didn’t want to learn whether or not their peers disliked them. Feeling like we lack the support and resources to deal with bad things makes us retreat into our old, comforting worldviews.
<h2>No problem? No need for a solution</h2>
In other cases, people don’t want to acknowledge a problem, whether it’s gun violence or climate change, because they don’t agree with the proposed solutions.

For instance, <a href="http://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/9256/Campbell%20et%20al._Solution%20Aversion.pdf">in a series of experiments</a>, social psychology scholars Troy Campbell and Aaron Kay found that people are politically divided over scientific evidence on climate change, environmental degradation, crime and attitudes toward guns because they dislike the potential solutions to these problems. Some don’t want to consider, say, government regulation of carbon dioxide, so they simply deny that climate change exists in the first place.

In the study, participants read a statement about climate change from experts paired with one of two policy solutions, either a market-based solution or a government regulatory scheme. Respondents were then asked how much they agreed with the scientific consensus that global temperatures are rising.

The researchers found that Republicans were more likely to agree that climate change is happening when presented with the market-based solution. Democrats tended to agree with the consensus regardless of the proposed solution. By framing the solution to climate change in terms that don’t go against Republican free-market ideology, the researchers suspect that Republicans will be more willing to accept the science.

In other words, people are more willing to accept politically polarizing information if it’s discussed in a way that doesn’t challenge how they view the world or force them to do something they don’t want to do.
<h2>Doubling down on a worldview</h2>
To return to Trump’s supporters: Many identify strongly with him and many see themselves as part of a new political movement. For this reason, they probably want to avoid new findings that suggest their movement isn’t as strong as it appears.

Remember those findings that many Trump supporters believe that he won the popular vote? Among Trump supporters, one poll suggests that <a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ljv2ohxmzj/econTabReport.pdf">52 percent</a> also believe that millions of votes were cast illegally in the 2016 election, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/28/donald-trump/donald-trumps-pants-fire-claim-millions-illegal-vo/">a claim Trump himself made</a> to explain his popular vote loss.

Accepting that their candidate lost the popular vote challenges deeply held beliefs that the nation has come together with a mandate for Trump’s presidency and policies. Information that conflicts with this view – that suggests <a href="http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/1/13/14250944/donald-trump-unpopular">a majority of Americans don’t support Trump</a>, or that people protesting Trump are somehow either <a href="http://www.snopes.com/anti-trump-protesters-bused-into-austin/">“fake”</a> or <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/18/tucker-carlsons-surprising-much-needed-takedown-of-a-paid-protester-hoax/">paid agitators</a> – poses a threat to these worldviews. As a result, his supporters avoid it.

Information avoidance doesn’t address why different people believe different things, how misinformation spreads and what can be done about it.

But ignoring the effects of information avoidance and discussing only ignorance and stubbornness does us all a disservice by framing the problem in partisan terms. When people on the left believe that only right wingers are at risk of changing the facts to suit their opinions, they become less skeptical of their own beliefs and more vulnerable to their own side’s misconceptions and misinformation.

Research suggests there are three ways to combat information avoidance. First, before asking people to listen to threatening information, <a href="http://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty/keith.chen/negot.%20papers/ShermanCohen_SelfDefBias02.pdf">affirmation</a> – or <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797611424164">making people feel good about themselves</a> – has proven effective. Next, it’s important to <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12160-012-9382-5">make people feel in control over what they get to do with that information</a>. And lastly, people are more open to information if it’s <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167215607842">framed in a way that resonates</a> with how they see the world, their values and their identities.

It’s crucial to recognize the all-too-human tendency to put our fingers in our ears when we hear something we don’t like. Only then can we move away from a media and cultural environment in which everyone is entitled to not just their own opinions but also their own facts.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align: center;">“If we don't share our stories, then somebody else is going to tell our stories for us," said Matthews.</h3>
&nbsp;

<em>By Taylor Tringali, staff writer</em>

Black Lives Matter is the historical movement catalyzed by the murder of Trayvon Martin which began online as a love letter to black people from the organization’s founder, Alicia Garza. Since its inception, Black Lives Matter has opened the conversation about injustices faced by black people and has garnered support and momentum in changing the long standing narrative about blackness in America.

I had the pleasure of speaking with the Director of Communications for the Black Lives Matter Global Network, Shanelle Matthews, who is also speaking at <em>frank</em> 2017. Shanelle fleshed out the crucial role of strategic communications in the Black Lives Matter movement.

&nbsp;

<strong>Taylor: What are you currently working on? </strong>

<strong>Shanelle: </strong>Right now we are working on a number of things, but from a communications perspective, we are working on developing an ideological intervention in America's consciousness about race and race reform. We work across issue area and across geography to eliminate state sanctioned violence against black people. We are training the next generation of black millennial leaders to make strategic interventions on race and racism in the media through Channel Black, an immersive training program I developed. Channel Black supports the debate, improv, cognitive linguistics, and media skills of black millennials working within the movement for black lives. Through that we hope to eliminate barriers to empathy and understanding and change the way people interact with black people and blackness.

<strong>How does storytelling drive your organization? How do you use stories to further the movement?</strong>

February 26th marks the 5-year anniversary of the murder of Trayvon Martin. Our movement and organization were catalyzed by this and we have told that story time and again. The stories of black people that are told every single day with regard to hate crimes they experience are the stories that catalyze our movement and our strategy every day. We talk about our experiences explicitly. There are long standing narratives about black people that shape the way people understand us and where we come from. If we don't share our stories, then somebody else is going to tell our stories for us.

<strong>What are some communication or campaign strategies you use that have been successful?</strong>

Over the course of the last 3 years we have built a fairly comprehensive editorial strategy. Building narrative is equally as important as building people power. We have a strong desire to use tested messaging to change the way people understand anti-black racism and blackness in America, so we work with cognitive scientists to develop messaging. We have also built relationships with local and national reporters who view us as a primary source of information when it comes to issues with racism and other issues impacting black people in America.

<strong>Social media has been a driving force for Black Lives Matter. How would you say you use social media as a tool?</strong>

<strong> </strong>More often than not, a lot of our political education and information dissemination happens through social media. So because a lot of our base gets their news online, we share a lot of information online. It’s the way we get out information about rallies, marches and events, or political education seminars. Black Lives Matter started online as a love letter from Alicia Garza to black people and transformed into an offline organizing organization. We use social media but we're also really mindful that our base lives real lives offline, so we also engage them there too.

&nbsp;
<h3 style="text-align: center;">“In order to change that behavior, you have to create a system of repetition around your issue in order to create new neuropathways in people’s brains so that they interact with black people and blackness differently," said Matthews.</h3>
&nbsp;

<strong>What are some challenges you've encountered on your journey with Black Lives Matter?</strong>

When you're a communications professional you understand that human behavior is predicated on people’s implicit bias. In order to change that behavior, you have to create a system of repetition around your issue in order to create new neuropathways in people’s brains so that they interact with black people and blackness differently.

Another challenge is dealing with anti-black racism in the media. As a former journalist I’m embarrassed to say that media makers do a poor job of giving reporters cultural competency. I spend a significant amount of my time doing political education with reporters and reminding them that they have a moral and ethical responsibility to report the news as unbiased as possible.

Finally, another challenge we have is propaganda. We're constantly dealing with propaganda about who we are and what we do. Because anti-blackness is so pervasive, people assume that everybody who works for BLM is exactly the same, which is bullshit. Every single individual who organizes with us has a different perspective and understanding of their work and a different level of commitment to the organizing that they’re doing. We have been very explicit about what it is that we do and unfortunately because black people are often not believed and are viewed as inherently criminal, people don’t believe us.

<strong>What are some things we can expect to see from BLM in the future?</strong>

The election changed a lot of things for a lot of people. While we're more mindful of how precarious life is under the Trump administration, our mandate has not changed. We will organize an end to state sanctioned violence so that all black lives matter. We will develop comprehensive strategies to implement organizing tactics on the ground so that people will take action on behalf of black lives. You can certainly look forward to us continuing to build narrative power and changing the way people understand and interact with black people in America.

<strong>Finally, do you have any words of wisdom for our fellow franksters?</strong>

I strongly encourage people at <em>frank</em> to draw their inspiration from people who have nothing left to lose. Secondly, it’s time to get uncomfortable and it’s time for each of us to imagine what it looks like to institute 21st century communication strategies in order to win.

		<title>Is Awareness Ever Enough?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<i></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the latest edition of <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/stop_raising_awareness_already">The Stanford Social Innovation Review</a>, Ann Christiano, the Frank Karel Chair in Public Interest Communications, and Annie Neimand, communications manager for the College of Journalism and Communications and research director for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> argue that changemakers must put an end to raising awareness. Instead, those seeking to move the needle on important issues need to adopt a public interest communications approach to driving social change. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">To prepare for the article, Ann Christiano interviewed Kristen Grimm, president of Spitfire, a public interest communications firm about raising awareness and if it has a place in campaigns aimed at driving social change. </span>
<p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This interview has been edited for length</span></i></p>
<b>Ann:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Raising awareness is not helpful, distracting [us] from the real issues, and it may even cause harm. In your work with clients and coaching nonprofits, is this something you still see people setting as a goal? Where does this come from?</span>

<b>Kristen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To me, the only reason to raise awareness is to then actually get people to use that awareness in some useful way, to avoid harm or to do something better for the world. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And that's generally what I tell groups every training. Everybody always start with raising awareness as an end into itself. So I will ask them,  “Are you okay if every teen in America knows that texting and driving is dangerous, but they still text and drive? Are you okay with that?” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And everyone would say, “No, of course not. We want them to get off their phones and just drive.” That’s the point. </span>What do you want people to do because they are aware? That is what I would get really focused on. You can start a sentence that way, you just can't end it.
<h2 style="text-align: center;">"What do you want people to do because they are aware? That is what I would get really focused on. You can start a sentence that way, you just can't end it," said Kristen Grimm, president of Spitfire</h2>
<b>Ann: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as a thought exercise, what if we abandon the idea of raising awareness and focus simply on the call to action, or in the case of texting and driving, inaction, and really focused on creating the circumstances where people are no longer texting and driving? What would that look like?</span>

<b>Kristen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Instead of saying, “Rais[e] awareness about the dangers of texting and driving,” you would say, “Stop people from texting and driving.” One of the steps in doing that is to get people to understand the very significant consequences. So a step along the way would absolutely be to get people to know about and act on the dangers.</span>

<b>Ann:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Is there a time when simply raising awareness of something could actually be helpful? With something like hurricane preparedness or texting and driving, you can make a pretty good case that what we want is a specific behavior change and not awareness. But when you get to issues that are murkier, like implicit bias, income inequality, racial inequality and police brutality, raising awareness might be more useful where the solution is not clear. I don’t really know what to do with implicit bias, but being aware that it is a thing makes me more sensitive to it in my own interactions with different people.</span>

<b>Kristen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The thing with implicit bias is they don’t want you to notice it and move on with your life. You are asking them to be aware of it and reflect, or be aware of it and call someone out, or be aware of it and change your own behavior accordingly. You want them to be mindful and do something with that. There is not always an obvious answer. Bullying has run into this a lot. As more people became aware of bullying, I still think a lot of people are unsure what to do exactly. But the point is you are trying to prime them so you can offer them different things that they are willing to do because they are aware that it is a problem.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes we raise awareness in order to create a cultural-environmental shift. There was this great article the other day, “<a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/10/18/did-tv-help-make-us-ready-for-hillary.html">Did T.V. make us ready for Hillary?</a>” They were talking about just having all these women on television playing presidential characters really changed our views that women could be president. Sometimes awareness is just to make you aware of the possibilities, and there it creates a different reality. It is not always actionable, but it creates space in your brain for later action. </span>

<b>Ann:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The other day in class (Ann teaches Public Interest Communications at the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications) we were talking about </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Harriet Beecher Stowe. They call her book “a book that started a war.” Her book did more to inspire an abolitionist movement than anything the strategists in the abolitionist movement did because her book was so popular and compelling. Even though it was a work of fiction, it helped people understand things in a new way. You can say the same thing about what </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Orange is the New Black</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has done for transgender rights and the rights of people in prison. It is changing the way we are perceiving prisoners’ rights. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Would you say that if awareness precedes reflection then awareness can be useful if we just don't know the answer to the problem yet?  For example, I have used Occupy Wall Street as an example. People camped out for months and months and nothing changed because nobody knew what Occupy wanted. But income inequality was a fundamental talking point in the presidential election because of what Occupy did.</span>

<b>Kristen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Right, you have hit on two things. You are raising awareness to what? Go back to <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. We wanted to raise awareness so people would empathize with prisoners. We thought if more people empathized with prisoners we [would] have an easier time getting reforms through. So I think you can have raising awareness for the purpose of an emotion. We know in order to get people do anything one of the first steps is they have to empathize with that population. It still raises awareness for a purpose, but that purpose is not for hardcore action, it could be for an emotion. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I would say the same thing for Occupy Wall Street. You can say, “I want to raise awareness for the purpose of making inequality part of the national agenda.” And five years later it is front and center. That can be your purpose, to raise the volume, because if we are talking about it we are more likely to do something about it. But you are still raising awareness for a purpose - to heat up a conversation. There is never awareness where you don't want it to change the person who became aware. </span>

<b>Ann:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I love your focus on changing emotion. People aren't not acting because they don't know. They aren’t acting because they don't care. By changing emotion and changing the way they feel about something, you are starting with making them care about it.</span>

<b>Kristen</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In </span><a href="http://www.spitfirestrategies.com/tools/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Activation Point</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, I discovered it goes into three categories, if you want to change something. You have to share knowledge, build will and then reinforce action. That first part, sharing knowledge, is you have to know, care and believe. A lot of times we do have knowledge. Like we knew a lot of people were getting locked up, we just didn't care. Maybe because it wasn't personal to us, maybe we didn't understand who those people were.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even when you look at stop and frisk, it is about who you believe. The community is saying, “When they stop and frisk, they are violating our rights. It isn't making anyone safer and it just creates a really horrible situation for people who are already disenfranchised.” The police chief is saying, “This is how we keep the streets safe, and if we don't like how you look we are going to frisk you and that will keep everyone safer.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">So those are two completely different visions of the same issue. For a long time we believed the police chief. After a while, we started believing the community because enough people showed us images, people we can empathize with, people who probably shouldn't be stopped and were just getting stopped because of the color of their skin. And that vision ultimately is here today. </span>

<b>Ann: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you seen a client or a nonprofit you have been coaching turn the corner on awareness? </span>

<b>Kristen:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I certainly think within the criminal justice field you have seen people get really advanced in getting off the numbers of people incarcerated. Those statistics didn't matter until people had something to anchor them into. Instead of focusing on the awareness of the numbers, focusing on the care and believe, care these people are getting shafted and believe this is not right for this country. Because they focused on different legs of that stool, you see the ability for more reforms, which you weren't able to see before.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think about the gender pay gap. This was an issue I heard about when I was in college. Only recently have we seen more efforts with Hollywood stars speaking out. You think about how long this has been going on. People just stay in that rut of, “Oh, if people just really knew the statistic, they would get so pissed off.” As opposed to how people's brains work, with implicit bias. Like “men are the head of the household, so they need to get paid more.” They rationalize that statistic.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most interesting things I have seen recently is a campaign that went after getting a regulation, where if you are over a certain size of a company, you have to report your salary data. This is a great change. Suddenly you are bringing transparency to it, and now companies are going to have to own up to it. That made it actionable for people to look at what their practices are, because they are going to have to report it to the government. They are making people aware because they have to report the data, and they’re actually saying “you should look at it because we are going to be looking at it too," and that is going to change a lot. </span>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Nat Kendall-Taylor, CEO of the FrameWorks Institute</em>

Conventional wisdom has it that we now live in a “post-truth” world where opinion is more powerful than fact—or at least that we’re heading in that direction. To explain this phenomenon, major news organizations are running pieces about our cognitive inability to separate fact from fiction and our ability—or seeming willingness, even—to delude ourselves on a collective level. At the same time, <u>advocates are emphasizing the importance of facts</u> and news organizations are running advertising campaigns about the value of truth. As a <em>New York Times</em> ad declares: “The truth is more important than ever.”

So, which is it: Do facts change minds, or not? We tend to think of this questions in simple terms: They either do affect how people think and act—or they don’t. The truth, however, is somewhere in between. Our research shows that facts <em>do</em> matter and that they <em>do</em> have persuasive power—but only if they are well framed.

At the <a href="http://www.frameworksinstitute.org">FrameWorks Institute</a>, we study how nonprofit organizations can frame messages to communicate effectively with the public. Facts are an important part of our work. Over nearly two decades, we have found time and again—on a wide variety of social issues—that facts on their own are not effective communications devices. When used in isolation, they do not cause people to change their attitudes and beliefs about social issues or motivate them to take steps to make change.

When researching how to frame immigration, for example, we found that the facts that advocates typically use to educate the public about the effects of immigration on our economy and on human rights <a href="http://www.frameworksinstitute.org/pubs/mm/immigration/index.html">did not change people’s opinions about reform or elevate their support for it</a>. In fact, these facts tended to have the opposite effect, increasing negative attitudes toward immigrants among participants across the political spectrum and reducing support for progressive reform policies.

The same basic finding played out in our research on criminal justice and child abuse. Communicating facts about racial disparities and inequity did not cause respondents to support policies that address these issues. Pointing to facts about the prevalence of child abuse in the United Kingdom, meanwhile, sapped support for policies to reduce it.

This is not to say that facts don’t matter. They do—so long as they are effectively framed.

In the same experiment about justice, we found that <a href="http://frameworksinstitute.org/assets/files/adolescence_youth/Talking%20Juvenile%20Justice%20Reform%20Final.pdf">framing facts about racial disparities and inequity around the value of pragmatism</a>—that we can and must find solutions that work to align the justice system with the outcomes we want it to achieve—<em>did</em> cause people to change their attitudes about the justice system and increased support for reform. We found a similar effect in <a href="http://frameworksinstitute.org/assets/files/ECD/nspcc_values.pdf">messages that followed facts about the prevalence of child abuse with robust discussions of solutions</a>. When paired with solutions, facts boosted engagement and support for evidence-based programs and policies to reduce child abuse.

Why aren’t facts effective on their own? Because they don’t interrupt our thinking. Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman, professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University, explains that people process facts through “System 1” thinking: the fast and semi-automatic way that the brain takes in and makes sense of information. The brain tends to fit unframed facts into existing, off-the-shelf, ways of thinking.

Framing facts around values, solutions, or other frame elements, however, can disrupt System 1 thinking and push people into “System 2” thinking, a more effortful and conscious way of thinking in which people consider new information, evaluate their opinions, and reassess support for solutions. If advocates communicate “just the facts,” the public will likely default to “System 1” thinking—and people won’t change the way they think about or engage with issues.

Frames also help people understand the size and scope of a problem and focus on solutions. When presented with facts alone, people tend to get “compassion fatigue” and suffer from “emergency inflation.” This is why frames that emphasize our collective ability to solve difficult problems—our efficacy—are so important.  Our research into criminal justice and child abuse showed that facts framed around efficacy boosted support for policy solutions.

The truth is we’re not in a post-truth world. Facts matter. They always have and they always will. And, when nonprofits frame them well, they can change public thinking, political discourse, our culture, and our society.

		<title>Who Are You Calling Anti-Science?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>By Troy Campbell and Lauren Griffin</em>

<em>Lauren Griffin, Ph.D., frank director of external research and the manager of the Journal of Public Interest Communications, and Troy Campbell, Ph.D., frank2016 winner of the frank Prize for Research in Public Interest Communications and assistant professor of Marketing at the University of Oregon, published an article in Scientific America. Read their analysis below.</em>

In a couple of weeks, crowds will march nationwide in the <a href="https://www.marchforscience.com/mission-and-vision" target="_blank">March for Science</a>. It’s part of a <a href="http://blog.ucsusa.org/ken-kimmell/scott-pruitt-anti-science" target="_blank">recent trend</a> <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/trumps-5-most-ldquo-anti-science-rdquo-moves/">pushing back</a> against “anti-science” attitudes that have become all the more prominent since last November’s elections. However, many at this march may greatly misunderstand the “anti-science” behavior they will be marching against. This misunderstanding may be misguiding us in our attempts to make science actually matter.

People’s relationship with science is much more complex and nuanced than "pro-science" or "anti-science." We need to correct some of the misconceptions we have and show that what is often labeled as "anti-science" or “science denial” is often better understood as isolated incidents of motivated bias. In general, trust in science is much higher than we often realize, in part because it includes a lot of people we might often consider “anti-science.”

For instance, a survey of “science lovers” would include people like Sally, an electrical engineer who loves <em>Mythbusters</em> but is skeptical of climate change, and Sam, an environmental advocate who loves science nights at Griffith Observatory but is also part of an anti-vaccinations initiative. Both of these people hold incorrect views about <em>specific</em> scientific topics, but both also self-identify as science lovers. When we label people like Sally and Sam as “anti-science,” we misunderstand much about their thought processes and risk pushing them away.

Today as the danger of so-called anti-science attitudes rise, we need to be more scientific about what we call science denial and ease our trigger finger off the damning label “anti-science.” When do this, we can see that complete denial of the value of empirical science—true anti-science attitudes—are less common than we realize, but other elements that may hinder scientific progress are more common than we’d think.

Seeing at least <em>some</em> of the denial of scientific facts in this light helps us better understand the mindsets of people like Sally and Sam who oppose the scientific consensus on specific issues like climate change and vaccinations, but generally support science. When it comes to “anti-science,” there are some true deceivers, and some truly anti-science people, but mostly it involves people with complicated views and biases. We suggest that those who truly love science will see why a better understanding of these complications is necessary to make science matter in this so-called “anti-science” era.

		<title>To Win Against False Information, We Must Play Offense</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span class="capital-letter">I</span>n what many are calling our <a href="https://ssir.org/articles/entry/persuasion_in_a_post_truth_world">“post-truth” world</a>, emotions tend to trump facts in the public’s views on policy and politics. The way people think about issues from climate change to GMOs to the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/3312930?seq=1%23page_scan_tab_contents">reflect their preexisting worldviews</a>. As a result, people create media <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2016/07/14/confirmed-echo-chambers-exist-on-social-media-but-what-can-we-do-about-them/?utm_term=.c5e450629fec">echo chambers</a> that reflect the beliefs, values, and information that support what they already believe. Consequently, this results in <a href="http://www.sciencealert.com/researchers-have-figured-out-what-makes-people-reject-science-and-it-s-not-ignorance?mc_cid=f77d5e2360&amp;mc_eid=95d1830874">the spread of false and politicized information</a>.

In this context, dispelling false information is one of the greatest hurdles for public interest advocates. Recent studies show that just reading false information more than once <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/xge-0000098.pdf">can make it seem more true</a>. Communicating the facts about climate change, public health, and human rights has never been harder. Many well-resourced special interest groups have a stake in politicizing information that minimizes or questions the negative effects of their respective industries’ activities on the public's health and well-being.

A dive into cognitive, behavioral and social science suggests potential tactics to counter these special interest groups’ efforts. As the research director for <em><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/">frank</a></em>, an organization housed in the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communications, I work on a team that aggregates and shares the science of how people think and make decisions to improve strategic communication in the public’s interest. One particular tactic continues to show positive results as a way to ward off false information. Scholars refer to this tactic as “inoculation.”

Just as vaccines inoculate the human body against infectious diseases, messaging that warns audiences of false and politicized information, coupled with information that debunks the false claims, can protect audiences in the long run. I like to think of this as playing offense rather than defense. Rather than waiting to defend your cause, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12171/epdf">research suggests</a> that we should preemptively prepare people to counter false and politicized information.

It is good practice to anchor this preemptive messaging in scientific consensus. Counter to popular belief, <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/02/politics-science-and-public-attitudes-what-we-re-learning-and-why-it-matters">people across the partisan divide consider scientific evidence</a> when forming policy beliefs and forming decisions. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12171/epdf">Telling</a> and <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12159/abstract">showing</a> audiences that scientists are in consensus increases support.

For example, the scientific consensus that climate change is a result of human activity has been well established—although climate skeptics often deny this consensus, citing uncertainty in the scientific community about the exact impact of human activity as reason to downplay the evidence. Sander van der Linden, a social psychologist at the University of Cambridge, and his colleagues at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gch2.201600008/full">recently conducted a series of experiments</a> to test the effectiveness of messages that countered false information questioning the climate science consensus. This research found that telling people there is consensus among scientists about the role of human activity in climate change was effective in increasing the public’s belief by 20 percent. Exposure to contradictory information weakened the belief by 9 percent, but an inoculation message that preceded the contradictory information reinforced people’s belief in the consensus, protecting up to two thirds of the scientific consensus. For example, a message that “some politically motivated groups use misleading tactics to try to convince the public that there is a lot of disagreement among scientists” protected the public’s support for the consensus message.

However, evidence and consensus that resoundingly supports your cause and solution is not enough. It is also critical that advocates’ employ digestible and engaging stories. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Numbers-Nerves-Information-Emotion-Meaning/dp/0870717766">Most people cannot connect with statistics and data alone</a>. Rather, people are more likely to engage with your cause when you couple messages that warn audiences about false information with stories about the facts or issue at hand. You can build empathy, support, and even action for your cause by <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15213269.2014.912585">telling stories</a> that transport your audience into the experiences of those affected by the issues. To reach people who are otherwise skeptical of your data, it is useful to tell stories that <a href="http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/polletta/files/2011/03/Polletta-et-al-ARS-Sociology-of-Storytelling.pdf">resonate with your audience’s deeply held beliefs</a> and highlight the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014002155">local impact on their communities</a>.

For example, public health advocates often have to go up against large and well-funded industries. “Powerful groups such as tobacco, soda, and pharmaceutical companies typically outspend health policy advocates by a considerable margin,” write researchers Jeff Niederdeppe, Kathryn Heley, and Colleen L. Barry. “This is likely to generate more frequent and recent exposures to industry anti-policy frames, which tend to emphasize personal responsibility for health, the threat of overzealous government intrusion, and the benefits of industry self-regulation.”

<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12162/epdf">Niederdeppe and his colleagues tested</a> the effectiveness of both inoculation and narrative messages that supported government regulative policies backing restrictions on the sale of soda in schools, graphic warning labels on cigarettes, and the prohibition of marketing efforts by doctors for prescription painkillers. Some participants read an inoculation message, while others read a narrative message against either sugary beverages, cigarettes, or prescription painkillers. Inoculation messages warned the reader of threats from these industries and also refuted arguments against the policy. One message, for example, read: “Big soda companies spend all of this money … because they don’t think people can make up their minds on their own. But we all have the freedom to think for ourselves about where we stand on policies that would reduce childhood obesity.”

Narrative messages, on the other hand, told stories about a woman named Cynthia and her daughter. In the stories, Cynthia’s daughter either struggled with weight problems as a result of soda or experimented with cigarettes, or Cynthia had an addiction to prescription painkillers. “Each story ... placed Cynthia’s struggles in a broader context (‘many parents face similar challenges’), and described how three specific policies could help to address the problem. The stories explicitly acknowledged personal/parental responsibility but emphasized the role that policies could play in reducing the impact of industry marketing,” the researchers wrote.

The researchers tested the effectiveness of inoculation and narrative messages immediately and one week after participants’ exposure to them. The narrative messages offset the immediate impact of messages opposing the given policy, but their influence declined slightly over time. Participants that read the inoculation message were less likely to be persuaded by the messages against the policy and were more likely to counter them one week later. The results suggest that a preemptive combination of narrative and inoculation messages can be effective in preparing audiences to resist false or politicized information.

<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12171/epdf">Research suggests</a> that corrective messages that debunk false claims also can reinforce support for the consensus scientific opinion. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12166/abstract">In one study</a>, political scientist Leticia Bode and communication scholar Emily K. Vraga tested the impact of corrective messages on perceptions of the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The authors note that while controversy and the rise of false information around GMOs is relatively new, experts agree that GMOs <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278691511006399">do not pose any health risks</a>. They first assessed participants’ attitudes toward GMOs and then presented participants with a simulated Facebook feed with a mix of posts, but one that shared false information through a news story (“GMOs make you sick”). After that, some participants saw a series of links in the simulated “Related Stories” section commonly seen on Facebook posts that pop up under an article. Some participants saw stories debunking the false information from the American Medical Association, others saw stories reinforcing it from Snopes.com, and some saw a combination of both or unrelated stories. Participants who already believed that GMOs were safe did not change their beliefs when presented with false information about GMOs. However, for participants that held incorrect beliefs about GMOs prior to the experiment, the links debunking GMOs as unsafe reduced their misconceptions.

In a time marked by increased polarization, advocates must employ the best of what we know from science to effectively refute politicized and false claims. Behavioral, cognitive, and social science provides a number of insights that can be used in campaigns and communication efforts. Across multiple disciplines, research suggests that a combination of playing offense by communicating scientific consensus, sharing stories, and inoculating audiences is one way to protect the facts and the issues we care about most in a post-truth world.

		<title>Going Beyond Resonance: How Social Change Advocates Can Craft Messages That Work</title>
		<link>http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/2017/06/going-beyond-resonance/</link>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Resonance: It’s the latest buzzword in strategic communications. But what does it <i>really</i> mean, and what is its role in effective advocacy messaging? Messages that resonate connect with people on an emotional level. Today’s communications professionals prize resonance as a sign that their messages are “working”—that they are provoking an emotional and memorable response in their target audiences.

At the <a href="http://frameworksinstitute.org">FrameWorks Institute</a>, we define messages that “work” in a different way.

When we say a message “works,” we mean that it helps people understand complex social problems and their solutions and motivates them to engage with issues in productive ways. We mean that it changes people’s attitudes about pressing social issues, makes them believe in their importance, and builds their support for solutions. Messages that work engage people; they drive them to take action and demand social change.

Resonance can certainly help advocates achieve these goals. But it’s no guarantee. There are messages that resonate that actually work against these goals—resonance can backfire. If we choose resonance as our desired communications outcome, we can end up with messages that resonate on an emotional level but detract on a strategic one—and take us further from goals like shifting the debate on immigration reform, supporting children facing adversity, or backing efforts to build support for systemic policies to address climate change.

Instead of thinking of resonance as a goal, advocates should think of it as a “mediating variable”—something that, in the vernacular of experimental research, helps explain the relationship between dependent and independent framing variables. In the context of strategic communications, resonance might help explain <i>why </i>a message works to achieve our goals, but it shouldn’t be the ultimate goal we seek. If want to create engagement on an issue, we should make <i>that</i> the outcome against which we measure message effectiveness. If we want to boost support for policy, we should use policy support as our message-testing yardstick. If we want to increase issue engagement, we need to find ways to test the ability of messages to build issue salience and engagement. If we choose resonance as an outcome, on the other hand, we will never know if our messages actually “work.”

If, for example, we choose resonance as a goal when developing communications about early childhood development, we might craft messages that focus on the role of parents. The American public sees <a href="http://frameworksinstitute.org/assets/files/PDF/NationalAssembly_MessageBrief_March2015.pdf">parents as the most important part of a child’s life</a>—by far. They believe that parents—to the exclusion of almost everyone and everything else—determine how children develop and turn out. This way of thinking is not wrong; parents, of course, do have a huge influence on their children, and building a communications strategy around this belief would surely resonate with the public.

But it doesn’t support thinking about the societal factors that determine children’s outcomes, such as good nutrition, high-quality health care, safe and stable housing, stimulating early education, and enriching interactions between young children and their caregivers. As a result, a campaign to increase structural supports for parents would likely fail if it were built around messages that focused narrowly or exclusively on the family—even though they might resonate with the public.

Our research shows that what we call <a href="http://www.frameworksinstitute.org/assets/files/ECD/resilience_mtg_final_v3.pdf"><i>Family Bubble</i> framing</a> causes people to place responsibility for children’s outcomes on parents, blame them for negative outcomes, and think of effective solutions as only those that narrowly target individual parents. What’s more, messages that activate the <i>Family Bubble</i> blind people to the societal and structural factors that directly and indirectly influence child wellbeing.

Moreover, focusing on parents privatizes child development by framing it within the family’s provenance. When people see responsibility for children’s development as within the family domain, they are less likely to support government programs and services that work in this area. Messages that trigger <i>Family Bubble</i> thinking can even cause people to become <i>resistant</i> to calls for better government supports, which are seen as incursions into the family sphere of rights and responsibilities.

Our research on framing education offers another example. When people are asked to think about what determines educational quality, the overwhelming answer is teachers. And when asked about what makes a good teacher, the <a href="http://frameworksinstitute.org/toolkits/tu/resources/pdf/understandingteacherscollectiveroleinreform-mapthegapsreport.pdf">clear answer is teachers who care</a> about their students. If we choose resonance as our goal, we would create messages about education reform that focus on the need for caring teachers. The problem is the direction that this resonance takes once it begins to resonate. In this case, focusing on caring teachers narrows the focus to only those policies that involve teachers; other initiatives seem misguided, as if they are missing the point.

In addition, when people define teacher competence as his or her innate caring for students and “love for learning,” the many other factors that influence teacher effectiveness, such as training, support, and resources, fade out and don’t matter. Moreover, the public sees a clear solution to education reform when thinking this way: fire teachers who don’t care about their students and hire those who do. The fire-and-hire approach becomes a silver bullet in the debate over education reform. Messages that cue these ways of thinking—a narrow emphasis on teachers and a focus on caring—run counter to the goals of those working to improve our education system.

When advocates confuse resonance with our ultimate goals—with what <i>really</i> matters—we open ourselves up to danger. We do need messages to resonate. But resonance must align with our strategic goals. Otherwise, our messages won’t work for us—and they may even work against us.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Some talents are cultivated, and some we are born with. Lisa Fazio, principal investigator at the </span><a href="https://my.vanderbilt.edu/buildingknowledgelab/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Building Knowledge Lab </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and a</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ssistant professor of Psychology and Human Development</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> at Vanderbilt University, was born to be a scientist. She has always been fascinated by the scientific method and discovery. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, she uses her passion to uncover how memory works, and, among other things, how false information is remembered and shared.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2015, she published the paper </span><a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/xge-0000098.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowledge Does Not Protect Against Illusory Truth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Fazio and her colleagues found that </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/frankology/repeat-after-us-repetition-can-make-us-believe-misinformation/">repetition</a> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">plays a critical role in remembering false information. Just hearing incorrect information more than once is likely to be remembered as true.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Fazio won the </span><a href="http://frank.jou.ufl.edu/about/frank-research-prize-finalists-2017/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Prize for Research in Public Interest Communications</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for this paper. We talked with Lisa about her experience at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2017, and what it was like to win the $10,000 prize. </span>

<b>What was it like attending </b><b><i>frank and frank scholar</i></b><b>?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was great! One thing I loved was getting to talk with people who actually do this for a living. They were really interested in knowing what the research had to say and how they could improve what they were doing based on the research the other finalists and I were presenting. </span>

<b>Tell us about the moments you were able to connect with people</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has a wide variety of people and they’re all interested in knowing the best practices so they can get the most out of what they are doing. I was also able to connect with all the people who spoke at </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Some were other researchers, some were practitioners. I connected with one woman there. We kept talking and we now have grant money together. It was just really great finding out what people (practitioners) who are actually doing this are interested in. What gaps do they see in the research, and how can we be helping them out?</span>

<b>What was it like presenting at f</b><b><i>rank</i></b><b>?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I really enjoyed it. The</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> frank </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">team did a really great job coaching me on how to present research to a lay audience. I developed this great framing and story that I could tell about my research that allows it to connect with people outside of the research world. It helped me a lot with the grants we just got. Knowing already how to present my work to them to get them interested and excited was really important.</span>

<b>How did it feel to win the $10,000 prize?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was great! That money is now sitting in an account at my university. What is amazing is I can use it for anything. Most grants have a lot of stipulations about how you can use the money and what you have to do with it. Now I have this pocket of money that I can really use to advance my research in the way that I think is most interesting. And we have already spent it doing some follow up studies that I won the research prize for. I wouldn’t be able to do without the award.</span>

<b>What is the relationship between your research and public interest communications?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I am really interested in how people learn and remember information. A lot of my work deals with what happens when people see information that is wrong or contradicts their prior knowledge. By knowing how people learn information from the world around them, you can take that to better design public interest communications strategies. These are the things that will make people think this is more true. These are the things that will get them to remember what is in your campaign. So knowing how memory works really helps people design their campaign strategies.</span>

<b>Can you tell us about your favorite moments from</b><b><i> frank</i></b><b> 2017?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The giant trophy I was handed when I won. I think it was for motorcycle riding. It’s amazing. The opening presentation! We were all sitting in the Hippodrome Theatre, and I had no idea what to expect. Then there is this amazing skit that really embodies that year’s theme of curiosity. I love that everything is done in a small theater where everyone is together. Everyone is watching the same thing. It is such a small space that the conference feels smaller than it actually is. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even just having drinks with people, chatting about what they do and what interests them about the research, what they still need more information on. I connected with Troy Campbell (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">frank</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> 2016 prize winner), he and I have kept chatting about research ideas and possibilities. </span>
<h4 style="padding-left: 60px;"><span class="purple">"As researchers, we need to know what the actual challenges are in the field. Where do these campaigns get stuck? Where do they have trouble that they need our help to get better? As a researcher I find it much more interesting to be dealing with a problem that has theoretical and practical importance,” says Lisa Fazio, <i>frank </i>2017 prize winner</span></h4>
&nbsp;

<b>Why should researchers apply for the prize?</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Many reasons. One it is a quick and easy submission process. It is not like writing a giant grant. It is less than a page. But it will get you to think hard about why your research is relevant to public interest communications. I really enjoyed getting to know other scholars that are doing research in this issue, but maybe not in my specific area.  Also getting to know practitioners who are doing the hard work of trying to get people to believe in their cause and take action toward it. Scientists really have a lot to offer to those folks.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">As researchers, we need to know what the actual challenges are in the field. Where do these campaigns get stuck? Where do they have trouble that they need our help to get better? As a researcher I find it much more interesting to be dealing with a problem that has theoretical and practical importance. I am learning more about how memory works and what things improve memory of different types of information, but I am also having an impact on the world and changing how practitioners do their craft.</span>
